description: Cut an Athenaeum release (stable or beta) — notes, version bump, the green-check rule, tag, the pipeline's gate/publish/verify/announce stages and what to do when one goes red. Use when the owner says "release", "cut vX.Y.Z", "tag", or asks what the pipeline is doing.

# Release

One procedure for every Athenaeum release. The tag pipeline does the publishing,
the docs site and the announcements; this skill's job is to hand it a commit
that can be released and to read its verdicts.

## Before you start

- You are in the main checkout on `main`, clean, and `main` == `origin/main` on
  both remotes (`git fetch all && git status -sb`). A worktree session cannot
  release — see memory `reference_worktree_session_release`.
- The GitHub run of the commit you will tag must be green. The pipeline's
  `gate:tests` job enforces it; you check first so a red gate never surprises
  anyone: `gh run list --commit $(git rev-parse HEAD) --json name,conclusion`.
- Keep the dev Mac idle while `build:macos` and `build:perseus:macos` run — the
  macOS runner is this machine and a saturated box times the job out.
- `root/artfrom-space` `main` must carry the three `download.md` markers
  (`<!-- latest-build:start -->`, `<!-- latest-build:end -->`,
  `<!-- version-history:rows -->`) — `docs:publish` fails naming the missing
  one otherwise.
- Four CI/CD variables the pipeline needs: `DOCS_REPO_TOKEN` (required:
  artfrom-space project access token, Maintainer, write_repository),
  `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` (recommended — effectively required if a gate ever has
  to wait or a tag is redone within the hour: the unauthenticated GitHub API
  limit is 60 calls/hour and the gate polls once a minute for up to 50
  minutes), `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS`
  (optional, MUST be the `[host]:40022` form that `ssh-keyscan -p 40022 <host>`
  prints, else `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes` refuses the upload), `RELEASE_ALLOW_AMD64_ONLY`
  (only while the arm64 Docker runner is down; unset afterwards).

## Procedure

1. **Notes.** Rewrite `RELEASE_NOTES.md` (fully replaced each release): an
   italic tagline line (`*Athenaeum vX.Y.Z: …*` — it becomes the blog excerpt,
   the Version History row and the chat teaser), then `## What's New` /
   `## Changes` / `## Bug Fixes` in user-facing English. This file IS the blog
   post: write it at that quality, there is no second text.
2. **Bump.** `scripts/release/bump.sh X.Y.Z[-beta.N]` — rewrites the six version
   files, refreshes `Cargo.lock`, asserts they agree.
3. **The release commit contains ONLY** `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, the six version files
   and `Cargo.lock`. A code fix goes in its own commit BEFORE this one and gets
   its own green GitHub run first. `git status --short` must list exactly those
   eight paths. Commit: `chore(release): vX.Y.Z — <tagline without the product name>`.
4. **Push main, wait for green, tag.**
   `git push all main` → wait for the GitHub run of that commit
   (`gh run watch` or poll `gh run list --commit <sha>`) → `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push all vX.Y.Z`.
   Pushing the tag before the run is green is allowed (the gate waits) but
   pointless; a red run means fix-then-retag, never force. The tag push
   starts a second GitHub run for the same commit; the gate reads whichever
   is the latest, so wait for the main-branch run to be green before tagging
   rather than relying on the tag's own run.
5. **Read the pipeline** (`http://192.168.31.208:9080/root/athenaeum/-/pipelines`, or
   the API with the PAT in `~/.config/athenaeum-ci/gitlab-pat`):
   - `gate` — `check:versions` (the only job in stage `gate`) red: a version file disagrees with the tag → fix,
     delete the tag on both remotes, retag.
   - `build` — three kinds of jobs run here. The seven platform-build jobs (`build:windows`,
     `build:linux`, `build:macos`, `build:perseus:*`) usually fail on runner problems (memory
     `reference_macos_runner_wedge` for Mac, `reference_linux_ci_runner` for Linux); a plain
     retry of the one job is the first move. `check:headless-core` red: a feature-gated compile
     break — a module reaching into `plate_solve`/`registration`/`catalog` without the matching
     `#[cfg]` (every `--workspace` command builds with `default = ["render", "solver"]`, so it
     compiles locally and fails only here and in Perseus jobs; this is exactly what happened to
     v0.5.5) → fix the code on `main`, get green, delete the tag on both remotes, retag; never
     retry the job. `gate:tests` (stage `build`, polls GitHub up to 50 min) red: GitHub is red →
     same fix-and-retag.
   - `publish` — `docs:publish` red without `DOCS_REPO_TOKEN`: create the token
     (artfrom-space, Maintainer, write_repository), set the variable, retry the
     job. Docker jobs are yellow-on-failure by design; the verify stage decides.
     `publish:updater-manifest` writes the frozen `updates/<tag>.json` from the
     signed `.sig` files `deploy` uploaded and asserts it names all 5 platforms;
     red because a `.sig` is missing from a build artifact means the build job
     did not sign — check that `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` (+ `_PASSWORD`)
     actually reached that job, fix, delete the tag on both remotes, retag.
   - `verify` — `verify:release` red names exactly what is missing (an installer
     URL, a Docker arch, the blog URL) — including, since the in-app updater,
     a manifest URL or a signature that failed to verify. Two cases:
     - **A signature or the manifest** (`verify:release` names a signature or the
       manifest itself, e.g. "does not verify" or a missing/mismatched platform
       entry): the published file is not the one the build signed (a stale
       `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`, a re-uploaded artifact) — do NOT announce, fix
       the cause, delete the tag on both remotes, retag.
     - **An installer URL, a Docker arch or the blog** (nothing signature-related):
       fix the cause, retry the failed publish job, then retry `verify:release`;
       the announce jobs re-run by themselves.
     `RELEASE_ALLOW_AMD64_ONLY=1` (project variable) accepts an amd64-only image
     while the arm64 runner is down — unset it afterwards.
     `verify:macos-gatekeeper` red: the published DMG is not accepted — do NOT
     announce; the notarization step is the suspect.
   - `announce` — `release` (GitLab Release), `publish:updater-channel`
     (copies the frozen per-tag manifest to `latest.json` / `latest-beta.json`
     — the same "only after both verify jobs" rule as the channel link, so a
     rejected build never becomes what the app offers), `publish_version`
     (`version.json`, kept until v0.7.0 for pre-updater installs),
     `publish:channel-link` (version-less `builds/latest` or `builds/beta` links
     move ONLY here, after both verify jobs — a rejected build never becomes
     `latest`), `notify:discord`, `notify:telegram`. Only these are user-visible;
     nothing before them is.
6. **Done when** the pipeline is green. Nothing else to do by hand: the blog post,
   the download page and the Version History row were written by `docs:publish`.

## Signing key

The updater's minisign key pair is generated once (`tauri signer generate`).
The private key and its password live in 1Password AND in the GitLab project
variables `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` / `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD`
(protected + masked, so only a tag pipeline sees them). **The key cannot be
rotated**: a new public key reaches an installed copy only inside an update
signed by the OLD key, so losing the private key means every installed copy
updates by hand from the download page, forever. The public half is
committed in `crates/athenaeum-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
(`plugins.updater.pubkey`) — before any tag, confirm that committed pubkey
is the RELEASE key, not a throwaway one from a local rehearsal (§7.2 of the
spec). Locally, `npm run tauri build` (`bundle.createUpdaterArtifacts:
true`) refuses to bundle without both variables exported in the shell —
`npm run tauri dev` does not need them.

## Re-tagging

`git tag -d vX.Y.Z && git push all :refs/tags/vX.Y.Z && git tag vX.Y.Z && git push all vX.Y.Z`.
Every stage re-runs; the docs commit is idempotent (same post, same row).
NEVER retry a build job of a FINISHED release pipeline — it re-fires the announcements.

## Where things are

- Pipeline: `.gitlab-ci.yml`; scripts + their tests: `.gitlab/ci/scripts/`,
  `.gitlab/ci/scripts/test/run_tests.sh` (run it after touching any of them).
  `run_tests.sh` also carries a `.gitlab-ci.yml` shape lint (every `script`/
  `before_script`/`after_script` entry must be a plain string or a list of
  strings, never a YAML mapping — the class of bug that silently breaks the
  whole config) — run it after touching `.gitlab-ci.yml` itself, not only the
  scripts.
- Updater manifest generator: `.gitlab/ci/scripts/gen_updater_manifest.sh`
  (tested inside `run_tests.sh`, not a separate file), invoked by
  `publish:updater-manifest`; `verify_release.sh`'s manifest checks
  (§1b, `rsign verify`) are the other half, run by `verify:release`.
- Artifact names: `.gitlab/ci/scripts/artifact_names.sh` — the only place a
  filename is spelled. Scheme `<product>-<version>-<os>-<arch>[-variant].<ext>`,
  arch ∈ {x64, arm64}.
- Docs site: `../artfrom-space` — generated files only; hand-edit guides, never
  the blog post of a release or the marked blocks of `download.md`.
- Runner smoke jobs `smoke:{macos,linux,windows}` (manual, on main) are the
  ten-second check that a runner takes work after a restart — play one instead
  of a build.
- Review that shaped this: `docs/superpowers/research/2026-09-15-release-cycle-review.md`.
