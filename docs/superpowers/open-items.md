# Open items

What is finished in code but not yet confirmed by hand, and what has already been
decided and should not be reopened. Everything here sits on `main` — the development
trunk since 2026-08-24, when the project went open source and version branches were
retired — and covers the eleven completed cycles on top of the last tag.

Plans, specs and audits live in `plans/`, `specs/` and `research/` beside this file
and hold the detail. This file holds only the residue: the checks nobody has run and
the calls that have already been made.

**Keeping it current.** A cycle that lands adds its unverified checks here. A check
that passes is deleted, not ticked — with the date and the measurement, if there was
one, moved into the cycle's own doc. A decision that gets ratified moves from
"awaiting a call" into "standing".

## Windows: fixed pending the final measurement; non-core surface still unmeasured

`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-07-windows-test-failures-design.md` §10 has the
full outcome. `athenaeum-core`'s 39 pre-existing Windows test failures (research:
`research/2026-09-06-windows-test-failures.md`) are believed closed — every
family was diagnosed and fixed, including one real production defect (a
received file's path was stored with a mixed separator on Windows, now fixed in
`sync/ingest.rs` and, by the same shape, in `sync/project_ingest.rs`) — but no
single Windows run has yet reported `0 failed` for the whole crate after all
eight tasks landed; the closest confirmed readings are 34 then 31, taken
mid-cycle. That gap is now closed — see the workspace-wide green reading
below. The `windows-latest` CI job exists (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and runs
on every push.

**Windows is measured green, workspace-wide.** At `6dcff6fe`, twice, with the
CI job's own command: 41 binaries, 2529 passed, 0 failed, exit 0 —
`athenaeum-core` 1728, `perseus` 439, `athenaeum-web` 27, `athenaeum-lib` 9.
The first fully green Windows workspace run in the project's history. perseus
went 227 → 31 → 0 across two fixes; the whole 227 was one cause (a path
spliced into a TOML basic string) wearing four symptoms — a parse error, nine
supervisor `Elapsed(())` timeouts, one `expect_err` that succeeded for the
wrong reason, and 27 more hidden in raw-string fixtures a first, too-narrow
drift guard could not see.

**The real-CI measurement is taken.** The `windows-latest` job (4 CPUs,
16 GB) has run green on `main` — first at `43270607` (2026-09-08, GitHub
run 34241175780) — so the developer-box readings are confirmed on the
runner. (From v0.6.1 to v0.6.2 both CI jobs were red on ONE deterministic
test, `a_tps_run_never_holds_more_than_a_few_displacement_grids_at_once`,
whose bound assumed a pool-bounded grid residency; fixed in v0.6.3 — see
the Stacking v0.6.3 subsection below.)

**`crates/perseus/src/` still has 14 slash-literal `join("M31/…")` fixture
sites** (3 in `pending.rs`, 3 in `library.rs`, 6 in `web.rs`, 2 in
`library/delete.rs`) — the same construction the scanner sweep (family D/H)
fixed in `athenaeum-core`. They pass on Windows today; they were never the
cause of perseus's 227 and are unswept, not cleared.

**23 unswept slash-joins in `archive/*` tests, plus 3 in export tests.**
Deliberately not swept this cycle: nothing there fails today and nothing there
is proven vacuous, but they are the same construction as the three tests this
cycle found passing vacuously on Windows and could be silently vacuous there
too. A later cycle's job, with its own judgement about whether each assertion
still asserts what it claims. The drift guard in `crates/athenaeum-core/src/test_support.rs`
that walks the codebase for this class of site scans **only `athenaeum-core/src`**,
not the crate's `tests/` directory and not the other workspace crates — which is why
an `athenaeum-web` fixture of the same family went unnoticed until a Windows run
found it.

**A Windows working tree cloned before `.gitattributes` landed keeps CRLF.**
Adding the file does not rewrite files already on disk. A developer (or a CI
cache) with an older checkout needs `git rm --cached -r . && git reset --hard`
once. This cost the cycle a full, misleading measurement (a 34-failure reading
taken on a stale CRLF tree, only reconciled after a second reading on a fresh
checkout matched it test-for-test).

**Three cross-platform behaviour changes, none Windows-only, none covered by a
test.** All in the sync receive path (`package::validate_rel_path` /
`sync::ingest::native_rel_path`): a drive-letter-shaped segment (`X:`) is now
rejected at *any* depth in a `rel_path`, not just the head — a legal POSIX
filename like `a/M:31.fits` is now refused where it was accepted before; it
fails closed at the sender. `native_rel_path` now drops a literal `.` segment.
It also collapses an empty segment, so `a//b` and a trailing `a/b/` both
normalize instead of round-tripping the extra separator into the stored path.

**Open question, not a finding.** The Windows failures of
`sync::ingest_tests::ingest_releases_conn_between_frames` are consistent with
the starvation mitigation being weaker there than CLAUDE.md's comment assumes:
`std::thread::yield_now()` on Windows is `SwitchToThread`, which yields only to
a thread ready on the *same* processor. Nobody has measured whether the W2
bounded-wait guarantee ("a concurrent lane waits at most one frame") actually
holds on Windows.

**`ingest_releases_conn_between_frames` still fails roughly 4 of 5 isolated
runs on a developer Windows machine**, measured during this cycle, unless the
CI skip flag (`--skip ingest_releases_conn_between_frames`) is passed — the
test also self-skips when `CI` is set, but a bare local run on Windows will see
it fail most of the time.

**The collab-contribution path fix (`sync/project_ingest.rs`) has no
regression test of its own**, unlike its sibling fix in `sync/ingest.rs`
(`ingest_stores_native_path_matching_landed_file`). Deliberate for this fix —
the mechanism is identical and already covered on the sibling path — but it is
a real coverage gap on `project_ingest.rs` specifically.

**The CI job needed `--no-fail-fast`**; without it the job measured one crate
and reported on nine, and would have gone green while 228 failures sat
unexecuted. `cargo test` is fail-fast across test binaries, so `cargo test
--workspace` stopped at the first binary that failed (`athenaeum-core`) and
never ran the other 40 — the output was byte-identical to a core-only run.
Found by running the job's own command on a real Windows machine, after every
review had passed the job.

**Five tests passed vacuously this cycle, and re-measurement found none of
them.** Three in `scanner/mod.rs` asserted absence at a path the catalog could
never spell. One was an `expect_err` that succeeded because the config failed
to parse, never reaching the condition it named. The fifth is the one worth
remembering, because the platform difference was in a **dependency** rather
than in our own code: `library/delete.rs` wrote a one-byte fake `perseus.db`
and then opened it, and SQLite silently **overwrites** a short non-database
file on macOS/Linux while refusing it on Windows (`SQLITE_NOTADB`). So "the
agent's own database survives" passed on macOS while the opener had already
destroyed the bytes it claimed to protect. A green suite is not evidence that
its assertions mean anything; only reading them is.

**A drift guard is only as wide as the spelling it matches.** The perseus
guard shipped matching escaped quotes (`"data_dir = \"{}\""`) and reported the
crate clean while seven raw-string fixtures (`r#"data_dir = "{}""#`) still
carried the bug — 27 failures behind a green guard. It was widened to look
inside raw-string literals too. Both perseus guards do line- and
substring-oriented matching over source, so they are only trustworthy on an
LF working tree; the Windows box agrees with macOS *because* of the forced
`git rm --cached -r . && git reset --hard` earlier in this cycle. A fresh
Windows clone that does not honour `.gitattributes` should not be assumed to
give the same reading.

**Windows runs ZERO collab tests, and the dead-code warnings are the only sign
of it.** 11 collab tests are `#[cfg(unix)]` (8 in `api/collab_exchange.rs`, 3 in
`api/collab_e2e_tests.rs`), so on Windows they do not compile and their ~17
helper functions warn as never-used — that is 17 of the 28 warnings the Windows
job emits, against 3 on Linux. The stated reason for the gate is "a multi-thread
runtime, because the loopback engines/receivers run their event loops on
background tasks", which Tokio supports on Windows, so the gate looks historical
rather than reasoned. Nobody has tried removing it.

**Do not "clean up" those warnings by deleting the helpers or adding
`#[allow(dead_code)]`** — that erases the only signal that a whole subsystem is
unmeasured on a platform whose CI job is now blocking. The two honest moves are
to make the tests run on Windows (gaining real coverage, and the warnings go
away as a side effect) or to put the same `#[cfg(unix)]` on the helpers and keep
this entry. Note collab coverage is already thin: 9 further collab tests are
`#[ignore]`d pending the publish rework (calibrated-export v2 §8a, decision C).

**The two `--skip`s in the Windows CI job are load-bearing, not cosmetic.**
`ingest_releases_conn_between_frames` is not fixed, it is skipped — measured
failing 4 of 5 isolated runs on the Windows box. `unclean_shutdown_mid_transfer_resumes_on_restart`
is skipped alongside it. Whoever removes either skip should expect the job to
start failing intermittently, and now that the job is a candidate to become
blocking, that is a trap rather than a nuisance. Both skips are also on the
Linux job, so the commands stay identical.

**The `format!("{x}/y.fits")` construction is a third member of this class**,
invisible to a `join("…/…")` grep. 18 such sites existed in
`api/scan_roots.rs` alone and the crate-wide survey reported that file as
having none. Any future guard for this class must cover both constructions —
and note that a naive one would false-positive on URLs, which legitimately
contain forward slashes.

## Standing decisions — do not re-flag these

Each of these has been raised by an audit or a review at least once and answered.
They read like bugs; they are not. Re-proposing them costs a cycle every time.

| Decision | Where it bites | Why |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Missing files are not orphans.** No pass anywhere may delete catalog rows because a path is absent from disk. | Scanner, any "garbage collect" proposal | Astro archives live on detachable storage. A file absent during a scan usually means the volume is not mounted, not that it was deleted. Auto-cleaning destroys the catalog the first time someone scans without the archive drive. If explicitly asked for, it is a manual opt-in operation with a preview — never part of scanning. |
| **A file in the Black Hole still counts as present** for transfer dedup, on both the pre-handshake Offer/Want path and at ingest. | `sync/responder.rs`, `sync/ingest.rs`, `find_files_by_content_hashes` | The bin is still the file being on the machine, so calling it a duplicate is honest. To re-receive, the user purges the Black Hole first — the hard delete drops the `files` row and dedup wants it again. An audit proposed excluding blackholed rows from the "have" set; rejected. |
| **One physical camera per scan root.** | Anything that would disambiguate two cameras sharing an `INSTRUME` label | Athenaeum does not read camera serials, and the owner already separates identical bodies by folder. Serial numbers, readout mode and other hardware fingerprinting are not needed — the scan-root path is the answer. |
| **Flats are shot after the session.** An equidistant tie-break prefers `FlatTiming::After`. | `flat_matcher.rs::apply_pattern_selection` and any flat tie-break | A post-session flat captures the optical state the lights were actually taken under: dust drift and dewing accumulated during the night. Do not reverse this to "prefer before" on the strength of literature that assumes a different workflow. |
| **The sampling xxHash used to verify a cross-volume move is intentional.** | `duplicates::compute_xxhash`, `file_op/executor.rs` | It reads first/middle/last 512 KB, so corruption in the unsampled remainder passes verification before the source is deleted. Speed was chosen over exhaustive verification; `verify_byte_identical` exists for callers that want the full check. Flagged as a bug in the 2026-06-10 audit and confirmed intentional. |
| **A NULL CCD-TEMP matches in `Warning` mode**, bypassing the threshold. | `calibration/configurable_matcher.rs` | Uncooled cameras write no temperature keyword; those frames should match rather than be excluded. Flagged in the same audit and confirmed intentional. |
| **The preview stretch is scale-adaptive.** | rustafits `stretch.rs` / `pipeline.rs` | The midtones parameter adapts to the normalized median, so `[0,1]` float FITS render almost identically to the same data in u16 ADU despite the hardcoded `max_input = 65536.0` — pinned by `unit_range_floats_stretch_like_u16`. A "missing float normalization" finding was raised and retracted. The real float bug was NaN poisoning the sample statistics, and it is fixed. |
| **The Folders deep-link token is deliberately not monotonic** (raise → consume → lower → re-arm). | Folders workspace deep-linking | Monotonicity was the replay bug. Restoring it reintroduces it. |
| **The calibration-set empty-prune trigger and `prune_orphaned_calibration_sets` are deliberately not identical.** | `db/schema.rs` | The per-row trigger exempts master-library sets because a master legitimately loses and regains its sole member during a re-import and the trigger fires inside that window. The whole-table prune runs only at quiescent points, where a member-less unreferenced master really is garbage. Both doc comments say so at length. |
| **The XISF parser drops the `comment` attribute of `FITSKeyword`, and fixing it is not a duplicate-detection fix.** | `fits_parser/mod.rs`, stored `fits_header.header` blobs | PixInsight writes history as `value="" comment="ImageIntegration.rejectedHigh_32: …"`, so our blob holds 364 empty `HISTORY =` lines. Including `comment` separates only 4 of 30 master groups — the other 26 share every keyword and property and differ only in pixels, so masters stay excluded from the header key either way. Processed **Light**-derivatives are a different case and the reason this is not free: a GraXpert/ABE output keeps `IMAGETYP = 'Light'` and `is_master = 0`, so the header key admits it and the erased history makes it identical to its source — they are shielded by the header key's `files.filename` component (spec D8), not by the master exclusion. Worth fixing for the metadata pane's per-field revert and light calibration's Bayer copy-through, which read that blob — but NOT in the same release as the duplicate-key change: a changed blob changes the fingerprint, so a re-scanned file stops matching its not-yet-re-scanned copy until both are scanned. |
| **The three-part sampling hash is not a better default key than the header.** | Any "just use `compute_xxhash`" proposal | It IS `files.content_hash`, so the proposal is the existing `Content` branch. Measured: identical answer to the header key on raw frames (40/40 vs 80/80 against full SHA-256) for 61.4 GiB of reads and ~19 min; and on masters it is wrong in the DELETING direction — three of thirty groups are `..._DBE_WCS.xisf` / `_f.xisf` pairs differing by 3-4 bytes at 0.5-0.9 MiB, past the first sample and nowhere near the middle or end. Spec §2.5. |

## Unverified by hand

Newest first. Every cycle below is code-complete with green gates and a clean final
review; what is missing is a human running the flow on real data.

### Stacking v0.6.3 — fix round (2026-09-15)

Four owner-reported bugs after v0.6.2 plus the red CI, on `fix/v0.6.3`
(`56f1cf53`..): the grid-residency test bound (`peak <= tps_frames` — the
integration source holds one inverse grid per spline frame for the whole
group, by design, R-T4-7), XISF `bounds`/`imageType`, the "Re-run from"
menu rebuilt to spec §8 + the plan's cleanup note + `metrics` rows surviving
`deleteIntermediates`, and per-frame progress from inside the fan-out stages
(`FanOutTicker`) with an Integrate message. Unit-pinned: the ticker's
monotonicity under free racing, the plan note's four cases, the cleanup
kind list, the XISF attributes. Not run by hand:

- **OWNER SMOKE OWED — XISF in the external tool:** header-patched copies of
  the v0.6.2 masters were written beside the originals for exactly this
  (`~/Pictures/ldn_test/ldn_final/LDN_1272_NoFilter_{osc_180s_160x,mono_180s_208x}_bounds.xisf`,
  the only change being `bounds="0:1" imageType="MasterLight"` in the XML);
  a v0.6.3-written master is the same header. What remains to confirm once
  it opens: levels (samples above 1.0 in saturated cores — the range is
  representable, not a clip), the mirrored orientation of a bottom-up set
  (R-T2-1, unchanged), `colorSpace="RGB"` on a 3-plane weight map.
- **OWNER CLICK-THROUGH OWED — progress on a real run:** Measure, Register
  and Local normalization rows now move per frame during a group's
  fan-out (they used to jump per group); the LN reference build shows
  "building the LN reference from N frames · plane p/n" at 0 %; the
  Integrate row reads `<group> · 37% · 3.2 GB / 8.1 GB · plane 1/3 · band
  12/51`. Every running row is `count · percent · bytes · group ·
  message` (`StageRow.tsx::progressText`). The throttle is unchanged
  (300 ms), so a fast stage may still show only its first and last tick.
- **OWNER CLICK-THROUGH OWED — the "Re-run from" menu:** with everything
  cached the menu lists Calibrate / Measure / Register (/ Local
  normalization) / Integrate, each live; after a `deleteIntermediates`
  run the cacheable entries show `stale` and are inert, the footer says
  "Nothing is cached — the run starts from Calibrate", and the plan
  warning line names the run and the policy. The owner's own set (109,
  prod catalog) is in exactly that state: run 1 cleaned it under v0.6.2,
  so its `metrics` rows are gone too and the line will NOT say
  "measurements are still cached" until a v0.6.3 run has measured it.
- **Deferred, named:** `metrics` rows kept by `deleteIntermediates` are a
  behaviour change for `get_stacking_work_usage`'s consumers only in the
  sense that nothing counts them (they hold no bytes) — verify the
  Working-folder card still reads 0 after a cleanup. The plan's
  `cleanup_stale_note` keys on the LAST run only: a `deleteIntermediates`
  run followed by a failed keepAll run yields no line (the staleness is
  then two runs old); acceptable, the stage rows still show `Stale`.
- **CI:** the release commit `f6312aef` was RED on both jobs — not on the
  grid pin (green on both platforms) but on two WALL-CLOCK probes the
  shared runners cannot honour: `local_normalization_sidecars_are_cached_
  on_the_second_run` (a fully-cached `stage_output` took 1.03 s against a
  1 s ceiling, Linux) and `sync_e2e::bidirectional_simultaneous_transfers_
  both_complete` (announce→fetching gap 346 ms against a 300 ms ceiling,
  Windows). Both ceilings are now logged-not-asserted under `CI`, the
  functional pins (`cached_ln`, the relative serialization assertions)
  untouched — the `ingest_releases_conn_between_frames` convention. The
  follow-up commit on `main` after the tag is the first candidate for a
  green reading; confirm both jobs on it. If another timing probe
  surfaces, gate it the same way rather than widening a ceiling.

### Stacking M4d — outputs (2026-09-14)

M4d (plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-10-stacking-m4d-plan-outputs.md`,
rulings R-M4d-1…7 plus the fix-round ruling R-T2-1): the calibrated CFA mosaic
artifact and Bayer drizzle, an XISF writer for masters/drizzled masters/weight
maps, the `master_lights` catalog table with a preview command and Results-card
thumbnails, and named user presets beside the three built-in transforms.
**Tasks 1–4 are code-complete with green gates and clean reviews
(`4748f91c`..`7d5e4780`), and the LDN 1272 acceptance run (Task 6) RAN on
2026-09-14 — `docs/superpowers/research/2026-09-14-m4d-acceptance-run.md`,
runs 34–36, verdict "M4d is accepted".** The final whole-branch review's one
Important finding is also fixed: the master-light preview render now takes
`image_semaphore` on both hosts (a cache hit stays permit-free), and the
Results card fetches a group's drizzle thumbnail only after its master
thumbnail has resolved instead of firing both at once. Everything below is
what the four task reports left open, plus what the acceptance run itself
left behind.

- **Acceptance run (Task 6), what it settled and what it owes:** Bayer drizzle
  CLOSES the M3/M4a residual "OSC drizzled G/B ≈ 10–12 % broader than the
  external tool's" — against the external CFA drizzle of the same frames our G
  is +0.5 %, B +0.2 %, R +4 %. **Ruling R-T6-1:** the plan's colour-fringing
  target "R/B centroid offset from G ≤ 0.1 px" is unattainable on this data by
  construction — the external tool's own CFA drizzle measures 0.28 / 0.21 px and
  the VNG-debayered control 0.15 / 0.13 — so it is re-stated as "offsets and
  per-plane FWHM ratios within 25 % of the external CFA drizzle's, same
  directions" (ours 0.36 / 0.23 px, R/G 1.24 vs 1.20): PASS. The broader R
  plane in colour-pure drizzle (R/G 1.24 here, 1.20 external, 1.06 debayered) is
  therefore a property of the data (a wavelength-dependent displacement that
  registration on the G-dominated frame cannot follow), not of the deposit —
  bounded by the 0.036 px same-star G agreement with the debayered control.
  Cost if the ruling is wrong: a real sub-0.1-px deposit bias hiding under a
  data-borne 0.3-px chromatic offset. **The XISF smoke FAILED on the owner's
  machine (2026-09-15):** the external tool refused the v0.6.2 masters —
  "Missing bounds Image attribute, which is mandatory for a floating point
  real image" — fixed in v0.6.3 (`bounds="0:1"` + `imageType`, see the
  Stacking v0.6.3 subsection). **OWNER SMOKES OWED:** the
  desktop click-through of the preset menu (save-as inline form, apply disabled
  during a run, delete confirm, the `'<name>'` label) and of the results-card
  thumbnails (master + drizzle, both groups). Not exercised by the run:
  `output.cleanup = deleteIntermediates` removing the mosaics (every acceptance
  run keeps `keepAll`; the policy is the one already governing `calibrated/`,
  unit-pinned in Task 1). Observation: the G plane's row-profile FFT line at the
  512-row band period is 1.8× its neighbourhood on the Bayer drizzle (R 0.66×,
  B 0.41×; the fold test shows no seam) — mild, worth a look if a seam is ever
  reported on a colour-pure drizzle. Deferred minor: the stacking paths gate
  reuses `api::sync::validate_transfer_dir`, so its overlap warning about the
  stacking OUTPUT folder reads "transfer folder overlaps a scan root"
  (`api/sync.rs:267`) — log wording, pre-existing since Plan 5a.

- **Task 1 (Bayer drizzle):** `DrizzleStats` carries no Bayer marker of its
  own — a run's provenance says whether it drizzled Bayer-pure only through
  `summary.config.drizzle.bayer`. At drizzle scale 1 with Bayer on, the R and
  B planes are 75 % zeros (only their own colour sites deposited), so their
  per-plane `fwhm`/`noise` stats are meaningless at that scale — don't read
  them there. The mosaic file is read once per OUTPUT plane, i.e. 3× per OSC
  frame, instead of once — a per-frame mosaic-plane cache would cut that I/O
  3× if Task 6's timings show it matters. A frame whose own `BAYERPAT` the
  catalog cannot parse never gets a mosaic and recalibrates on every run —
  by design (warned once per frame, never eliminated: eliminating it needs a
  per-frame phase read in both the plan gate and the run, or a "nothing to
  keep" marker artifact). Coverage above drizzle scale 1 is unpinned by any
  test — Task 6 measures it against R-M4d-7's target (R/B ≈ 0.25–0.5 of G's).
- **Task 2 (XISF output):** XISF masters of bottom-up sets are NOT
  row-flipped — flipping would have to transform the master's WCS/SIP cards
  too (`CRPIX2`, the CD matrix, the odd-`v` SIP terms), which is its own
  feature; the follow-up is named "flip rows + transform WCS/SIP" (ruling
  R-T2-1). The rejection maps' missing `ROWORDER` is fixed in the final
  review wave (`rejection_map_cards` now copies it through, matching
  `weight_map_cards`). `XISF:CreationTime` is the wall clock, so an XISF
  master is not byte-reproducible across two runs of the same input —
  every byte-identity pin stays on `format = fits`. A non-ASCII card value
  logs the sanitize warning twice (once in `xisf_keyword_value`, once in
  the shared card-parity check). The "defaulted `0:1` bounds" premise was
  wrong — the format has NO default for a float image and the attribute is
  mandatory; v0.6.3 writes it. What the external tool still has to confirm
  (v0.6.3 subsection): the padding declared inside `headerLength`, samples
  above `1.0`, and `colorSpace="RGB"` on a 3-plane weight map.
- **Task 3 (`master_lights` + preview):** the group-row `update_group` call
  and the `master_lights` inserts share one pooled connection but are NOT one
  `rusqlite` transaction (the pre-existing shape of `update_group`) — a crash
  between them leaves a group row naming a master with no catalog row for it.
  A `master_lights` insert failure in the drizzle-success arm fails the group
  even though the master is already written on disk (consistent with the
  adjacent `update_group(...)?`, which has the same property; if the policy
  is revisited, move the three inserts and two updates together). Cache
  freshness (`cached_at >= master_mtime`) has a same-second window on
  coarse-mtime filesystems. `list_master_lights` has no production caller —
  it is brief-mandated API surface, not dead code. The default preview size
  512 is stated on both sides of the boundary (the command's default arg and
  the frontend hook's default). The Results card's `<img>` used to carry
  `loading="lazy"`, which deferred nothing because `useMasterPreview` fetches
  eagerly on mount — removed in the final review wave (`89bc6d9c`), which also
  made the card fetch the drizzle thumbnail only after the master's resolves.
  The plan text's own R-M4d-5 wording and one test doc comment
  (`api/stacking.rs`, near `master_preview_caches_and_re_renders_when_the_
  master_changes`) still showed the superseded `_<max_px>.jpg` cache-file
  pattern (fix round 1 keyed the cache on the resolved render STEP instead)
  — the test doc comment was fixed as part of this docs task (a comment-only
  edit); the plan text is left as-is, as history.
- **Task 4 (user presets):** `StackingSection.tsx`'s own preset selector
  (Settings → Stacking, the global defaults) was NOT extended with user
  presets — out of the brief's scope, still built-ins only.
  **OWNER CLICK-THROUGH OWED:** the tab's preset menu — save-as
  inline form, apply, delete confirm, and the quoted label. Deferred minors
  from the Task 4 review: Escape inside the inline save form closes the
  WHOLE menu, not just the form (an acknowledged trade-off, noted in a code
  comment); `StackingTab.tsx` grew +259 lines this task — a `PresetMenu`
  component is the obvious seam the next time the file is touched; the
  `<input maxLength>` counts UTF-16 units while the server counts scalar
  values (the client is stricter for astral characters, so this can never
  cause a spurious server-side rejection); and no test exercises real
  contention on the presets' `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction (`begin_presets_
  write`).
- **Cross-task:** the headless check (`cargo check -p athenaeum-core
  --no-default-features`) does not exercise `integration/` or `stacking/` —
  already recorded under Stacking M4c below; one pointer is enough rather
  than repeating the finding.

### Stacking M4c — algorithms (2026-09-12)

M4c (plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-10-stacking-m4c-plan-algorithms.md`,
rulings R-M4c-1…11 plus the fix-round rulings R-T0-1/2, R-T2-1, R-T3-1, R-T4-1…5 and
R-T5-1/2): the structure-map seed detector as an option
(`measurement.seedDetector`, default `peak`); min/max, generalized ESD and RCR as
user-chosen pixel rejection with the Auto ladder unchanged; Winsorized sigma clipping
on the reference loop with a zero-MAD fallback; large-scale rejection through
processed `.rejl` bitmaps and a second integration pass with its own `pass2/` bitmap
set; thin-plate-spline distortion with the local distortion loop; and LN's local-scale
spline plus the barycentre second matching pass. **Tasks 0–5 are code-complete with
green gates and clean reviews, and the LDN 1272 acceptance re-run (Task 7) RAN on
2026-09-12 — `docs/superpowers/research/2026-09-12-m4c-acceptance-run.md`, runs 22–33,
verdict "M4c is accepted"** (its own rulings and follow-ups are the Task 7 bullet near
the end of this subsection). Everything below is what that run weighed, or what it
left behind.

- **Not re-measured (Task 0, minor m9):** the Measure stage's memory admission was
  sized for the peak detector; the structure path allocates its own map, blurred and
  dilated copies per plane and nobody re-measured the admission against it.
- **Residual (OSC), second signature (Task 0, ruling R-T0-2):** two unrelated noise
  estimators agree to 11 % on the mono planes but diverge 1.67 / 2.20 / 2.04× on the
  debayered OSC R/G/B (176 real planes), which is exactly where both detectors
  overshoot the external tool's fit counts. The structure map halved the M4a excess
  (3.8–6.9× → 2.46–3.86×) without closing it and made OSC blue worse (PSFSW ρ 0.683 →
  0.423), so the next investigation is the VNG-debayered planes or the PSF fitter's
  acceptance on them, **not another detector**.
- **Deferred (Task 1 review, 5 minors):** the `robust.rs` cross-check comment
  overclaims f32/f64 sameness for its planted values (`6 + 0.5k + 0.01·seed` is not
  f32-exact); the board labels `Min/max (l/h)` / `ESD (f, α, ρ)` / `RCR (limit)` are
  capitalised and parenthesised against the lowercase house style (the brief's verbatim
  text, kept this cycle); the RCR clean pin sits at exactly 57/60 with zero margin and
  wants a "this means the estimator moved" comment; `rcr_line_fit_deviation` does a
  TLS + `RefCell` + SipHash lookup per phase-0 iteration (the first suspect if RCR is
  slow in Task 7) and inserts a degenerate `sxx ≤ 0` entry; `t_quantile` returns the
  bracket end silently.
- **Re-tune candidate (Task 2):** the Auto ladder's Winsorized thresholds (4.0/3.0,
  `8 ≤ n < 20`) may want a re-tune now that the scale they multiply is ≈ 14 % smaller
  on real stacks — measured on 21 LDN 1272 mono frames, rejection ×2.54 at +2.0 %
  master noise and −3.9 % PSF SNR. Task 7's call, the same kind of calibration
  `LINEAR_FIT_SIGMA_SCALE` got in M4a.
- **Cost, bounded (Task 2, ruling R-T2-1):** a zero-MAD stack always burns the 20-pass
  cap, ≈ 4.8× a non-degenerate stack of the same size, so the worst case is ≈ 5× the
  combine phase on a fully tied integer bias master. Outcome-insensitive (any cap ≥ ~8
  passes leaves the same survivors); if a real bias build ever looks slow, this is the
  first place to look.
- **Gate correction (Task 2, verified):** `cargo check -p athenaeum-core
  --no-default-features` does **not** exercise `integration/` — `lib.rs` gates it on
  `render`, proven by a deliberate type error in `combine.rs` that left the headless
  check green. Only `geometry/` is genuinely ungated among the trees this cycle
  touched. Related: `cargo test --lib` hides example breakage; re-gate a
  public-signature change with `cargo check -p athenaeum-core --all-targets`.
- **Deferred (Task 3, large-scale rejection):** the filter's scratch is `2 · W · H`
  bytes per rayon worker (≈ 52 MB at 6248×4176, ≈ 520 MB transient on a 10-worker
  pool), unbounded — a row-ring `hsum` plus bitset masks would bring it to ≈ 7 MB per
  worker; `large_scale_rejected_fraction` counts bits over the full geometry including
  never-covered pixels while its doc says "samples"; the majority cascade needs a DENSE
  rejected structure, so a sparse real-trail mask may be erased (Task 7 check m5: does
  mono frame `_0085`'s mask survive the cascade?); **no preset enables the feature**
  (adding it to `MaximumQuality` would double every such run's integration time —
  owner call); the "drizzle skipped … second pass's rejection bitmaps are unavailable"
  warning is not gated on drizzle being enabled, so standalone large-scale with a
  `pass2/` write fault warns about a drizzle that never ran; and the "pass-2 set
  unusable → skip drizzle, no fallback to pass-1 bits" path has no persisted regression
  test (verified by reading, the sabotage was reverted rather than committed). Pass 1
  also still computes rejection maps that pass 2's replace when `writeRejectionMaps` is
  on.
- **Deferred (Task 4, TPS):** the grid RELEASE mechanism landed after the acceptance
  run's first TPS attempt stalled the machine (ruling R-T4-6, `8f7f1242`: every stage
  releases a frame's grid when done with it; `set_plane` wired so integration opens
  ONE source per group — R-T4-7); what remains is residency — integration holds one
  inverse grid per frame for a whole group (≈ 208 × 4.5 MB ≈ 0.9 GB on this set; a
  per-band release would rebuild every grid every band) and drizzle rebuilds a colour
  frame's forward grid once per plane (the plane loop is outer; ≈ +8 min on 160 OSC
  frames — swapping the nesting means restructuring the per-plane I/W accumulators);
  the doc drift the last fix round left is CLOSED by the final fix wave (the enum
  doc's build count and its derived minutes, the five stale "8.6 MB per direction"
  copies in `pixel_map.rs`/`writer.rs` → 4.5 MB, and the two comments R-T4-7 made
  stale in `integrate.rs` ~1185 and `ln/reference.rs` ~9 — `registered_source.rs`
  ~99 was never stale, it describes LN accurately); what that same enum's cost table
  still ignores is the large-scale second pass; **LN could use `set_plane` the way
  R-T4-7 wired integration** — `ln/mod.rs` ~405 opens a `RegisteredSource` per frame
  PER PLANE inside its own plane loop, so an OSC frame builds three displacement
  grids in the LN stage where one would do (2 of 3 builds per colour frame saved, the
  same change integration already took); `drizzle::band_source_window` costs a few
  hundred exact probes × up to 600 nodes per band on a TPS map; **a TPS row's
  hold-out `rms_px` is not
  comparable with a polynomial row's in-sample `rms_px`**, and the frames table shows
  both in one column (1.47 px against 0.93 px on the same scene, with the spline 11×
  more accurate against the truth field) — the column wants a note or a split; the
  `pair_through` two-subjects-one-reference correspondence ambiguity stands for **every
  model** (TPS is merely the first consumer that cannot tolerate it — `dedupe_nodes`
  guards the spline, nothing resolves the pairing itself); in the cap-bites branch an
  UNselected duplicate pair stays in the hold-out set (asymmetric with the 80/20
  branch, never flattering); a superseded incumbent's note can survive a kept round in
  `warnings`; and nothing in the tests distinguishes the common-set accept guard
  (R-T4-5) from the old per-model one (the `dedupe_nodes` doc and the dead
  `TpsGrid::len`/`is_empty` were fixed in fix round 2).
- **Deferred (Task 5, LN):** the ±1–2·σ_z local-scale ripple SHIPS — with `localScale`
  on and no true structure the sampled `A` carries a spurious smooth surface of
  peak-to-peak 0.92–2.18·σ_z (10 seeds, σ_z ∈ [0.031, 0.038]), pinned at 3.0·σ_z by a
  no-gradient control; Task 7 variant E weighs it against the real flat-field residual,
  and only then does the math reference's surface-simplification step or a node-count-
  aware λ get implemented (ruling R-T5-1). `ln_pass` and `ln_local_nodes` reach the
  **logs only** — not `LnFrameOutcome`, the run summary or provenance — and do not
  exist at all on a cache hit, so "how often pass 2 fires on real frames" is
  unmeasured. The trailing-node clamp convention (`(i·stride).min(width−1)`, shared
  with `background_grid` and `ln_probe`) lives in prose at three sites rather than in a
  shared helper. A comment in the noise-control test misattributes σ_z ≈ 0.03 to the
  `NOISE` level where `LOUD` is what produces it.
- **CLOSED (Task 0, comment-only, final fix wave):** `structure_map`'s 0.56× → 0.60×
  for the sensitivity-0.5 plane-anchored ratio (the figure the adjacent pin states);
  the noise-comparison doc table's `all` row now says its min/max ARE the group
  extremes and names the source report's 2.2443 as the transcription typo it is; and
  the "correlated noise" attribution is hedged to "consistent with", the evidence
  being a ratio rather than a measurement of the correlation.
- **Deferred (whole-branch review, recorded by the final fix wave, not fixed):**
  - a TPS `transform_json` is ≈ 100 KB per frame (≈ 40 MB of `registration_results`
    rows per 368-frame `tps` run), and with `writeRegisteredFrames` on it becomes an
    `ATH_REGT` CONTINUE chain of ≈ 140 KB per registered frame —
    `fits_writer/card.rs` puts no cap on a chain's length, and **no test round-trips a
    TPS map through `build_registered_cards` → `FitsHeader::get_str`** (the existing
    round-trip pin writes a plain `homography`, no distortion at all, so its
    `transform_json` is one card), so that is an untested combination. Both
    toggles default off, which is why it is a note and not a blocker.
  - `ln::scale::fit_local_scale` dedupes its nodes by reference INDEX but has no
    `align::dedupe_nodes` equivalent — no `TPS_MIN_NODE_SEPARATION_PX` separation
    test — so two DISTINCT reference stars closer than 0.05 px would make the
    Bookstein system singular and the whole local-scale surface is dropped with a
    `warn!` instead of one node being removed. Honest, just more pessimistic than it
    needs to be; never observed on real data (688/688 channel-frames fitted in the
    acceptance run).
  - `student_t::with_esd_lambdas` does one thread-local `RefCell` borrow plus a
    SipHash `HashMap` lookup PER PIXEL STACK (≈ 26 M per plane). Correct and bounded,
    but it is the first thing to look at if ESD ever reads slow; hoisting the
    `(n, alpha)` slice per band would remove both.
  - **PRE-EXISTING, outside this branch:** 85 references to another image-processing
    application BY NAME across `src/` and `crates/` — including a serde wire token
    (`FlatNormMode` in `src/types/models.ts` ~745 and its Rust source), which cannot
    be renamed without a migration. A project-wide naming cleanup with its own cycle,
    not an M4c item; M4c's own code names nothing.
- **Owed (owner), after Task 7:** an own look at the acceptance masters and the desktop
  click-through of what M4c added to the tab — the Measure panel's `Seed detector`
  select (with the two peak-only controls disabled under `structure`), the Integrate
  panel's three new rejection methods and its Large-scale rejection block, the Register
  panel's `tps` distortion with `TPS smoothing (λ)` and `Local distortion loop`, and
  the Normalize panel's now-live `localScale` checkbox. Task 7 will add its own lines.
- **Task 7 acceptance (2026-09-12, `docs/superpowers/research/2026-09-12-m4c-acceptance-run.md`):**
  the Winsorized deferral of spec §6.3 is CLOSED — the real master dark rebuilt with the
  new reference loop sits inside every target (median −0.002 %, MAD +0.010 %, hot pixels
  −0.855 %). The lines that stay open from the run:
  - **RCR and Winsorized clip star cores on the OSC red plane** (RCR: faint-star peak
    p10 0.67× the baseline's, second-moment width +3.4 %; Winsorized 4/3: p10 0.73×,
    width +1.0 %; mono, G/B and the brightest stars untouched) — a Chauvenet / k·σ high
    side on the skewed per-pixel distribution of VNG-interpolated cores. Both are opt-in
    and outside the Auto ladder at n ≥ 20; the Integrate panel's help owes a caution for
    colour data (final fix wave), a star-protecting variant is a later item.
  - **ESD rejects 0.15 %** on this set (the brief's 1–5 % was a guess; the trail is
    still rejected) and every non-linear-fit method's master is 6–13 % quieter than the
    5.0/3.5 linear fit's — the Auto linear-fit thresholds cost real noise for their 3 %;
    a re-tune candidate, not an M4c defect.
  - **Large-scale rejection costs 3.5× the integration time** (37 vs 11 min) for no
    visible gain on a set whose one trail the per-pixel clip already removes; its case
    is the shoulder a per-pixel clip misses (pinned synthetically).
  - **TPS: ruling R-T7-1 sets `tpsSmoothing`'s default to 0.5** (hold-out rms 0.099 /
    0.156 px vs 0.145 / 0.203 at λ = 0; 5.6 % of frames reach the 3-round cap at 0.5) —
    the final fix wave changed the default. It does NOT move "the registration hash for
    `tps` sets only", as this bullet first claimed: `registration_subtree` serializes
    `cfg.registration` whole (no `skip_serializing_if`), so `tpsSmoothing` is in every
    set's registration hash whatever the distortion — the pin
    `the_tps_fields_move_the_registration_stage_hash` shows it under `distortion: off`.
    A default-VALUE change alters only documents that OMIT the field (a stored
    `"tpsSmoothing": 0.0` stays 0.0 — serde's default fills a missing field only), and
    the hash consequence was already absorbed when M4c added the field: every set
    re-registers once on the first M4c run, as CLAUDE.md says. A TPS run costs ≈ +25 %
    wall (49 vs 40 min) from the per-stage grid
    rebuilds; drizzle still rebuilds a colour frame's forward grid once per plane
    (≈ +8 min on 160 OSC frames — the plane loop is outer); integration holds one
    inverse grid per frame for a whole group (≈ 0.9 GB at 208 frames). No measurable
    FWHM gain over `polynomial3` on this field.
  - **The M3 drizzled OSC G/B FWHM residual (≈ +6 % ratio) is unchanged under TPS** —
    it is not registration distortion; the VNG planes / M4d's Bayer drizzle own it.
  - **LN local scale's ripple is measurable:** +3.1 / +5.4 % master noise on G/B at
    σ_z ≈ 0.10 (R −3.4 %), corners < 0.1 %, LN time within noise; the math reference's
    surface-simplification step (or a node-count-aware λ) is the follow-up before the
    flag can default on. The barycentre pass won on 6.2 % of channel-frames.
  - **Owed (owner):** the desktop click-through of the Integrate / Register / Normalize /
    Measure panels (two Chrome instances were connected to the automation; a static
    check of the served bundle stands in), and the Windows/Linux runs.

### Stacking M4b — mixed pixel scales (2026-09-11)

M4b (plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-10-stacking-m4b-plan-mixed-pixel-scales.md`,
rulings R-M4b-1…9): per-frame pixel scale from the stored plate solve or the header
(`GroupFrame.pixel_scale_arcsec`/`scale_source`) feeding a plan-time WARNING (never a
blocker) and a per-frame registration scale gate centred on the frame's own implied
ratio to its reference; a WCS seed built from both frames' plate solves when both are
solved, falling back to the quad matcher otherwise; a `registration.geometry:
coRegistered | native` mode where native gives each group its own reference and
geometry with no cross-group registration; and the frames table's `WCS` chip on a
seeded row's registration model.

- **Acceptance run 2026-09-11** (`docs/superpowers/research/2026-09-11-m4b-acceptance-run.md`, 7 runs on the
  30-best-frames subsets of sets 166 / 108 / 195, both modes): every cross-scale group registered onto
  its reference through the plate-solve seed at the expected scale — ×0.207 and ×1.457 (set 166, rms
  ≤ 0.61 px), ×0.502 (set 108, rms ≤ 1.02 px, same-star centroids 0.15 px between the bin-1 and bin-2
  masters), ×1.285 (set 195's 352-mm subsets, rms ≤ 0.64 px); native mode gave each group its own
  reference, geometry and WCS with `ATH_RGEO = 'native'`; the reference's own master is bit-identical
  between the modes on all three sets; the header convention R-M4b-1 held on 1 781 solved frames
  (0 beyond 2 %). Four acceptance-time fixes landed: T6-F1 (plan-gate readiness and scale statistics
  over the included frames, R-T6-6/7), R-T6-4 (seed trigger 5 %), R-T6-9 (the plate-solve seed as the
  fallback after a quad failure), R-T6-8/10 recorded as data/target rulings.
- **Residual (registration):** the quad seed does not converge for an H-alpha field against an O-filter
  reference of the SAME rig (set 195: 14 of 30 frames, both field rotations, all well solved) — now
  carried by the plate-solve fallback (R-T6-9); the quad matcher's own robustness across filters is an
  M4c registration item (spec §14).
- **Policy (M4c):** `failOnMaxRms` off lets a registration with rms 44 px into the stack with only a
  warning (one H frame of set 195, an H→O quad mis-match that "succeeded") — treat an RMS beyond a hard
  multiple of `maxRmsPx` as a registration FAILURE so the fallback and the exclusion apply.
- **Calibration matcher (not M4b):** frame geometry (`NAXIS1/2`) is not a matching parameter — a
  same-camera calibration set from another ROI links (set 166: a 9576×6388 flat matched a 6384×4258
  master dark) and the master build refuses it at run time; the plan gate cannot see it.
- **Noise:** the run emits one `skipped: fewer than 3 included frames` warning per excluded group (14 on
  set 195) — fold them into one line.
- **Deferred (final review, R-T6-9 re-review):** a solved reference frame that needs fresh registration
  builds one wasted `seed_from_solves`; when quads partially succeed, drop below `MIN_INLIERS`, and the
  hint fails to confirm too, no warning records the hint attempt.
- **Deferred (final review):** the Stacking tab now shows two differently-scoped `Scale` columns — the
  groups table's is the group's PIXEL scale in "/px (R-M4b-7), the frames table's is each frame's LN
  RELATIVE scale — told apart only by their header tooltips; one of the two wants a clearer name.
- **Owed (owner):** own look at the masters of a real mixed-scale set in both modes —
  the Ghost Nebula (set 195, ×1.27 within one group — masters `Ghost_Nebula_QHY_{H,O}_mono_300s_*`),
  M 78 (set 108, bin 1 + bin 2 — `M_78_L_mono_*`), and the ×7 / ×4.8 set 166 — and the desktop click-through of the Geometry radio, the
  `Scale` column with its `×r` badge and the frames table's `WCS` chip (the acceptance
  verifies them through the web build only).
- **Data limitation, recorded:** set 138's 352-mm 20 s groups have no flats at that
  focal length and no 20 s darks in the catalog (the app's own matcher refuses the
  30 s/−10 °C darks), so the ×2.82 case was swapped for set 166 (ruling R-T6-3 in the
  plan's ledger); set 138 stays as the negative case — its plan must show the `links`
  blocker.
- **Deferred (final review):** native-mode register staleness reads only the last
  done run's `summary_json` (the brief's stored-metrics best-by-weight first is not
  implemented), and because `SummaryGroup.reference_frame_id` is `Some` only for a
  written master, a group that registered but wrote no master reads stale — the
  conservative direction (a redundant re-register, never a stale cache trusted).
- **Deferred (final review):** in native mode one group's `reference_stars` failure
  fails the whole run, consistent with stage 5's existing policy but a new blast
  radius since groups are otherwise independent — real data (Task 6) decides whether
  it needs a per-group `fail_group` path. The same whole-run failure applies to
  `resolve_group_geometry`'s per-group `frame_calibration_hash` at stage 4: one
  group's unresolvable hash takes the run down with it, for the same reason and with
  the same fix if one is wanted.
- **Deferred (final review):** `run.rs` is ≈ 13 000 lines after M4b — a
  `stacking/register_stage.rs` extraction is due before M4c adds to stage 5.
- **Deferred (final review):** `GroupsTable.tsx` hand-mirrors `SCALE_TOLERANCE = 1.25`.
- **Deferred (final review):** `groups.rs::median_f64` duplicates `weights::median_of`.
- **Deferred (final review):** `align.rs::gate_center` reconstructs the applied gate
  from `expected` (exact for both producers today).
- **Deferred (final review):** the dead `order.clamp` in
  `plate_solve/storage.rs::sip_pair`.
- **Deferred (final review):** `drizzle/geom.rs` imports through `geometry::linear::`
  instead of the re-export.
- **Deferred (final review):** coverage gaps — the 500-id chunk boundary of the
  solve-scale query, a reference frame without a scale, a partially-scaled group.

### Stacking M4a — measurement seeds and the PSF fitter (2026-09-11)

M4a (plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-10-stacking-m4a-plan-quality.md`, rulings R-M4a-1…19): noise-relative measurement seeds (`measurement.detectionSigma`, calibrated to 20 on 368 external frames) with the reference's adaptive region and inner-region acceptance; the linear-fit rejection on the minimum-absolute-deviation line; the two-pass registration-reference pick; the LN row-evaluator weight table and borrowed reference planes; the XISF reader fixes; `PSF_FIT_VERSION` in both artifact hashes. **Acceptance run 2026-09-11** (`docs/superpowers/research/2026-09-11-m4a-acceptance-run.md`, run 13 on LDN 1272, 56 min): mono meets every target (fits 1.02/1.05/0.82 of the external tool's, PSFSW ρ 0.92, top-20 18/20, drizzle ratio equal to the external's to 0.6 %); rejected fractions 2.985 % / 2.733 % at the Auto 5.0/3.5 with `LINEAR_FIT_SIGMA_SCALE` left at 1.0; the two-pass pick switched the reference to the frame the owner had pinned by hand (`_0073`); LN 368/368 with no exclusions (the R-M4a-15 recompute confirmed against M2's numbers). Two residuals, both OSC, recorded below.

- **Residual (OSC weights):** the bright, undersampled night (measured FWHM 1.55 px)
  still yields 3.8–7× the reference's fit count (run 13: OSC PSFSW ρ 0.93/0.82/0.68 against ≥ 0.90; top-20 15/20 passes; the M3 night inversion is gone); two bounded experiments with a
  3×3 median pre-filter on the detection image (rulings R-M4a-13/-14, the
  option ships off) closed ~20 % of it and cost the blue channel's weight
  correlation. Closing it properly needs the rest of the reference's
  structure-map front end (math reference §5.1) — tracked as M4c Task 0
  (the structure-map seed detector, ruling R-M4c-11), not a smoke.
- **Plan-gate note (twoPass).** With `reference.twoPass` on,
  `plan.rs::compute_register_stale` (ruling R-M4a-6) correctly reports
  Register "not stale" against a switched reference — but the two-pass
  pick's own dry pass over the reference's group is NOT cached and reruns
  on every run regardless of staleness (bounded, ≈ 1–2 min on the LDN 1272
  acceptance set). Informational, not a bug.
- **Cleanup candidate: `MeasureOptions.min_snr ≤ 10` is inert.** The
  detector's own gate (`snr > 10`) already excludes everything a
  `min_snr` at or below 10 would filter, so such a config value changes
  nothing measurable; noted for a future cleanup pass, not fixed here.
- **Two pre-existing load flakes seen during M4a** (both pass in
  isolation, both predate this cycle — not new regressions): the M3
  drizzle `rej/run-<id>` cleanup-on-cancel tests (a race that Task 4's
  RAII de-registration change narrows but does not fully close) and
  `sync::ingest_tests::ingest_releases_conn_between_frames` (a
  self-documented timing probe).

- **Residual (OSC drizzle):** the G/B drizzled/undrizzled FWHM ratio is 0.836 / 0.819 against
  the external tool's 0.744 / 0.737 under the same (new) estimator — +12 / +11 %, the M3 residual
  unchanged in kind; the weight change moved it by ≈ +1 %. Ruled out so far: rejection strength,
  level conventions, registration distortion, weights. M4c: a common-subset drizzle with both weight
  sets and a star-by-star comparison across magnitudes (the external R plane is its own outlier, ecc 0.41).
- **Integrate stage cost (ruling R-M4a-17):** run 13's Integrate took 10.85 min for both groups against
  run 11's clean 5.01 (2.2×, at the revisit threshold) — measured while the controller's own comparison
  scripts ran on the same machine, so an upper bound; the mono group alone was 1.7×. The hybrid option
  (the robust line on the first rejection iteration, least squares afterwards) is the recorded fallback if a
  clean re-measurement exceeds 2×.
- **Owed:** the owner's own click-through on the desktop build of the Measure panel's `Detection threshold (σ)`
  field, the Reference panel's `Two-pass pick` checkbox and the results card's `switched from #… (two-pass)` line
  (the acceptance verified them through the LAN browser's accessible text only — the narrow viewport refused
  screenshots again).
- **Owed:** one M4a run on Windows and one on Linux (the web build) — the two-pass dry pass and the `.rej`
  sink condition are the platform-neutral parts; nothing platform-specific was added, but the suite's two
  load flakes (below) are worth watching there.

### Stacking M3 — drizzle (2026-09-10)

M3 (drizzle 1×/2×/3× with exact-clipping square drops or tabulated circle/
gaussian ones, per-frame rejection bitmaps, weights and local normalization,
the weight map, a scaled WCS, `DrizzlePanel` live) plus Task 8, the
sky-penalized normalization anchor (ruling R-M3-17). Acceptance run on the
real LDN 1272 catalog on 2026-09-10 — note
`docs/superpowers/research/2026-09-10-m3-acceptance-run.md`: drizzle 2× on
both groups, level-preserving, seam-free, fully covered; the mono
drizzled/undrizzled FWHM ratio equals the external reference's to 0.05 %; the
OSC master now matches the external one in level and background shape after
Task 8. Two misses/gaps recorded below.

- **M4 item: the OSC drizzle is ≈ 10 % broader than the external one by the
  fitted FWHM** (G/B ratios 0.83 / 0.82 vs 0.75 / 0.74; re-measured under the M4a estimator in run 13: 0.836 / 0.819 vs 0.744 / 0.737 — see the M4a section) while the same bright
  stars' half-maximum radii are 4 % smaller in ours and our drizzle carries
  26 % less pixel-scale noise at equal master noise. Ruled out: rejection
  strength, level conventions, registration distortion (polynomial3 changed
  nothing). Compare star by star across magnitudes; drizzle a common subset
  with both weight sets.
- **Provisional constant:** `DRIZZLE_SECONDS_PER_PLANE_AT_2X = 1.2` in
  `stageSummary.ts` measured 1.17 s (mono) / 1.33 s (OSC per plane) on a
  clean 16 GB machine — keep; revisit with the M4 performance work.
- **Owed:** the owner's own click-through of the Drizzle panel, the board
  toggle and the drizzled lines on the results card on the desktop build
  (the acceptance click-through ran over the LAN and the Windows browser's
  renderer refused screenshots after the notifications dialog — the results
  card was verified through its accessible text only).
- **Owed:** one drizzled run on Windows and one on Linux — the `.rej`
  positional writes (`write_at` / `seek_write`) and the memory refusal are
  the platform-specific parts.

### Stacking M2 — local normalization (2026-09-10)

M2 (local normalization: background-model grids, PSF-flux scale, `.athln`
sidecars, the LN reference, `NormalizePanel`'s LN block). Acceptance run on
the real LDN 1272 catalog on 2026-09-10 — note
`docs/superpowers/research/2026-09-10-m2-acceptance-run.md`: LN end-to-end
on both groups (368/368 sidecars, no exclusions), master noise at 0.89–1.13×
the external reference, no mesh imprint at the grid stride, cached sidecars
re-used on a re-run from Integrate, cleanup removes `ln/`. Two attributed
misses, both recorded below.

- **Attributed miss (no code): LN stage time.** ≈ 28 min for 368 frames
  (mono ≈ 19 frames/min, OSC ≈ 10/min) on the 16 GB acceptance machine —
  the per-frame fan-out admits one OSC frame at a time under the RAM probe,
  so the stage is memory-bound, not CPU-bound. Re-measure on a ≥ 32 GB
  machine before treating it as a performance defect; the M4 performance
  item covers the algorithmic side (detect-once, shared star lists). Partly
  addressed in the M2 final fix wave: the reference's star fit was being
  recomputed per frame (`relative_scale`); hoisted into a per-group
  `PreparedReferenceChannel` so it now runs once per group, not once per
  frame — the per-frame PSF cost roughly halves. Re-measure this stage's
  wall time in M3's acceptance run.
- **Owed:** the owner's own click-through of the LN block on the desktop
  build (Enable local normalization, scale, reference frames, the `local`
  rejection-normalization option and its 5 s reset notice, `LN: n/m frames`
  in Results, the frames table's Scale column) and of the narrow-layout
  toolbar: the acceptance click-through at ≈ 1250 CSS px found the toolbar
  row overflowing the pane (fixed in the M2 final fix wave — the fix is what
  needs the owner's eyes at 1024 px).
- **Owed:** one LN run on Windows and one on Linux (the web build) — the
  sidecar writer's tmp-and-rename and the fan-out's RAM probe are the
  platform-specific parts.

### Stacking M2 — camera-agnostic grouping (2026-09-10)

M2 Task 10 (owner decision 2026-09-10): groups are now keyed by colour
mode/filter/binning/exposure cluster, not camera/geometry — the group key
string format changed (`<mono|osc>__<filter>__bin<n>__<exposure cluster>`,
no camera/geometry token; master filenames now always carry a colour-mode
token instead, fix round 1 ruling).

- **Carry-over (no code, fix round 1 item 8):** the OLD key format's
  `calibrated/<old key>/` working-folder trees and their `stacking_artifacts`
  rows are orphaned by the key change — nothing looks them up under the new
  key, and nothing cleans them up automatically. "Delete intermediates"
  (Settings → Stacking → Cleanup, `output.cleanup`) clears them along with
  everything else in the working folder; absent that, the first post-change
  run on an affected set simply recalibrates (stage 1 finds no fresh
  artifact under the new key and redoes the work — no correctness issue,
  just a one-time cache miss and stale bytes left behind until a manual/
  `cleanup_stacking_work` sweep).

### Stacking M1 — the Stacking tab (2026-09-10)

M1 Plan 5b (the Stacking tab, Settings → Stacking, retirement of the
plate-solve-era registration flow). Acceptance run passed on the real LDN 1272
catalog on 2026-09-10 — note `docs/superpowers/research/2026-09-09-m1-acceptance-run.md`
(the run rebuilt its own ten calibration masters from an empty library, and its
masters are bit-identical to Checkpoint B's; one attributed miss: measurement
time on a 16 GB machine). The tab is enabled for every build since that run.

- **Owed:** the owner's own click-through of the Stacking tab on the desktop
  build — board/inspector/frames/results, Settings → Stacking, the frame-set
  page showing no Registration tab — and specifically the **narrow-layout
  check** (disclosure, toolbar wrap, table overflow at ≈ 900 px), which the
  acceptance harness could not take (its browser window ignored resizes).
- **Owed:** one stacking run on Windows and one on Linux (the web build) — the
  acceptance run was macOS only; the folder validator, `statvfs` free space and
  the fan-out's RAM probe are the platform-specific parts.
- **Follow-up (web host, found by the acceptance run):** opening Settings →
  General wedged the web server — `api::account::build_status` →
  `TokenStore::load` → `SecKeychainFindGenericPassword` blocked in a mach
  call to `securityd` (a macOS Keychain access prompt for an unsigned binary)
  and every other request queued behind it. The account status must not block
  the runtime: `spawn_blocking` around the keychain read and no shared lock
  held across it.
- **Follow-up (M4 performance):** the measurement fan-out admits
  `clamp(RAM/4 ÷ working set, 1, cores)` frames and the working set is
  8 planes × W × H × 4 B — on a 16 GB machine that is one OSC frame at a
  time (10.4 min for 368 frames vs the 5 min target). Measurement needs far
  fewer than eight full planes resident; recompute the working set from what
  the measurement actually holds.
- **Minor UI (fix wave of Plan 5b):** Integrate summary "min weight 0.01" for
  0.005; master labels with 0-decimal exposures ("Flat 0s"); the Integrate
  row's "N / M · P %" pairing a per-group count with the current group's band
  percentage; the main pane scrolled horizontally after the provenance modal
  (frames table wider than the pane); a cancelled run's board showing every
  stage as "Skipped" (Calibrate had completed from cache, Measure was
  interrupted); "—" in the frames table's Group column before any run.
- **Dev-workflow note:** the Vite dev server cannot call a separately running
  web API (no CORS layer, no proxy) — for a same-origin dev run build the
  frontend with `NODE_ENV=development VITE_TARGET=web npx vite build --outDir <dir>`
  and serve it with `ATHENAEUM_STATIC_DIR=<dir>`.
- **Follow-up (not a bug, Task 8b fix round 1):** Stage 0.5's
  pre-calibration listing is a plan-time choice: when a raw flat set links a
  RAW DarkFlat sub-cal set, `select_flat_precal` skips it at plan time and
  names the Dark master, but the run builds that darkflat master first (it
  is in `raw_sets_without_master`) and the flat's rebuild then prefers it —
  a Dark listed that way is rebuilt without being read (harmless), or, if
  unrebuildable, blocks a run that would not have read it. Fix when it
  bites: re-resolve after the darkflat builds, or list both.

### Lights + calibration sets export lands raw originals, not built masters (2026-09-08)

Owner report: the "Lights + calibration sets" mode exported Athenaeum-built
masters. Root cause: a master build repoints every consumer link onto the master
(`register_master` step 5), and the sets-mode transform was a no-op over the
linked tree. Fix: `export::data_collector::resolve_raw_calibration_sets` swaps
each built master for the raw set it superseded, following the raw set's own
links; imported masters stay (warning); originals not on disk block the mode up
front (`ExportReadiness.missing_raw_calibration_files`, both export and send).
Pinned by six collector/summary tests, one send test and two readiness tests.

- Export a set whose darks AND flats have built masters, mode **Lights +
  calibration sets**: the tree and the disk must hold the raw darks under
  `DARKS_<raw id>` and the raw flats under `FLAT_<raw id>`, and no
  `master_*.fits` anywhere. The tab's file count must equal what landed.
  **Lights + masters** on the same set must still land only the master files.
- Same set after **Archive originals** on one of those raw sets: the sets-mode
  radio must read "N raw calibration file(s) missing on disk — restore from
  archive first" and the tab must fall back to another mode; restore the
  archive and the mode comes back.
- A frame set linked to an IMPORTED master (dropped into the Calibration
  Library by hand): the sets mode must still run, land the master file, and
  the completion notification's warnings must name the set as an imported
  master exported as is.
- Frame-set **Send** in the sets mode after a build: the receiver must get the
  raw frames (regrouped into sets by its post-package pass), not the master.

The companion Folders change from the same evening — the Missing Files panel
now also renders on ROLE folders, so a master whose file is gone can be purged
(and its raw set un-superseded) from the Calibration Library rather than only
from Equipment — is verified and needs no smoke: click-through on the web build
plus the owner's own confirmation in the desktop dev build, 2026-09-08.

### Plate-solve input-gate controls (2026-09-07)

Backlog v0.5.6 item 1. Frontend-only: `PlateSolveSettingsPanel.tsx` grew a
**Batch Concurrency** field in Solver Parameters and an **Input Gate** section
(`input_gate_enabled` toggle, `input_max_eccentricity`, `input_min_trail_r2`,
the two numbers disabled while the toggle is off). No Rust change — the three
commands already round-tripped the whole struct, which is why the fields
persisted without controls. Gate run: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean. There are no
frontend tests in this repo to add to.

- The whole acceptance check is by hand: the toggle and both numbers survive
  Save → restart; **Reset to Defaults** puts back 0.85 / 0.65 / on; the three
  fields that were already on the tab still save; and a frame the gate
  previously refused attempts a solve again once the toggle is off.
- The copy states the measured reference ranges and says plainly that tightening
  will **not** catch more trailed frames (backlog item 4: the full analysis path
  under-reports eccentricity on exactly those). Worth reading once on screen —
  it is the sentence the retracted v0.5.5 release note got wrong.
- Owner decision, 2026-09-07: the acceptance-gate group
  (`blind_*`, 7 fields) stays unexposed. It is what stopped v0.5.5's false
  16–193x solutions from reaching the catalog. If it ever surfaces it belongs
  behind an "Advanced" disclosure naming the failure it prevents.

### Integration throughput (2026-09-06)

Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-06-integration-throughput-design.md`, branch
`perf/integration-throughput`. Master-frame integration 6.2x faster (233 s → 37.7 s
on a 100-frame set) by resolving the band-memory budget from RAM instead of a
hardcoded 256 MiB, holding band buffers in the source's own sample format, and
making reads positional and parallel. Master pixels verified byte-identical
(fingerprint `a4f6bb5158714175`, reproduced across six cold runs) — see the design's
§1 principle 4 for why that is by-construction on every path, not just the
measured `I16Be` one. Final whole-branch review's fix wave applied (cancel-mid-build
now actually stops the write/register, combine-phase progress ticks instead of
freezing at 100%).

- An SSD-backed scan root has no measurement at all yet (spec §9 lists it as an open
  item) — the storage class D3 expects to benefit most from read concurrency.
- **`cargo check -p athenaeum-core --no-default-features` does NOT compile
  `integration/`** — the whole module is `#[cfg(feature = "render")]`-gated at
  `lib.rs`, so a green headless check exercises none of this cycle's code and must
  never be cited as evidence for it. `masters.rs` and `light_cal.rs` are render-gated
  the same way. The only headless-relevant gate for this cycle is that `--workspace`
  still builds and tests green with the feature on (the default).
- After the 2026-09-06 review fixes: start a 100-frame build, press Cancel
  mid-read, and confirm the row stops within a couple of seconds (it used to
  wait for the whole band, ~6 s on the owner's 30-frame dark, ~25 s on a
  100-frame set) and that the log shows only "master build cancelled" for
  that set, no "finished". Watch the percent on a two-band build (any
  100-frame set on the 16 GB machine): it must climb without ever stepping
  back across the `integrating` → `combining` boundary.

### Blink full-resolution VNG (2026-09-06)

Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-06-blink-full-resolution-vng-design.md`.
`Resolution::Full` now debayers a CFA frame at native resolution with the gradient
method instead of halving it with the super-pixel one; one such render at a time
(`VNG_GATE`); the preview cache gained a byte budget
(`blink.memory_cache_max_mb`, default 512 MB); the desktop command returns
`tauri::ipc::Response` so a 17 MB JPEG no longer crosses IPC as a JSON array.
Measured on a real ASI2600MC frame through the shipped converter path: 6248x4176
out, 752 ms, 17.2 MB JPEG, 555 MB peak RSS (super-pixel: 3124x2088, 45 ms, 4.5 MB,
228 MB). Crops of both were eyeballed — same star colours, no demosaic artifacts.
What no one has run is the app itself.

- Press ScanEye on an OSC light in Blink and confirm the canvas is genuinely
  native resolution (zoom to 1:1 and compare against the same frame in an external
  viewer), that the load feels bounded by the ~0.8 s render rather than by IPC, and
  that pressing it again returns to preview.
- **Measure the IPC leg** while doing it. The change from a JSON array to an
  `ArrayBuffer` is verified in the pinned tauri sources, not in the running app. If
  the transfer still dominates the ~0.8 s render, that is a finding for its own
  cycle — do not patch it blind (spec 4.4).
- Star annotations (`A`) on a full-resolution OSC frame: the overlay scales by the
  render/analysis ratio, so a resolution change should be transparent. Confirm the
  ellipses still land on stars.
- Set Settings -> Blink Viewer -> Image Resolution to **Full**, open a 200+ frame
  OSC set, and watch RSS. The expectation is a plateau near the 512 MB cache budget
  plus one ~0.55 GB render, not unbounded growth. Note that the webview holds one
  blob per cached frame on its own side — the Rust budget does not bound that
  (spec 7); if the renderer process is what grows, that is the known gap.
- Mono at Full is meant to be untouched and must not queue behind a colour render:
  blink a mono set at Full and confirm it is as fast as before.
- Settings -> Blink Viewer: the new **Memory Cache Limit (MB)** field saves,
  reloads, and rejects values outside 64-16384; the amber warning under Image
  Resolution appears only for Full.
- After the 2026-09-06 review fixes: with Image Resolution at **Full** and an
  OSC set buffering in Blink, open the file browser and hover thumbnails —
  they must render while the VNG prefetch is still running (the gate no
  longer sits inside the shared image semaphore).

### Calibrated-export v2 (2026-08-31)

Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-31-calibrated-export-v2-design.md`. The
standalone "Calibrate Lights" op is gone; the **Calibrated lights** export mode now
calibrates every LIGHT frame at export/send time from its linked masters, applies
hot-pixel cosmetic correction from the master dark, and VNG-debayers OSC lights
(`rustafits`'s `astroimage::processing::vng`), engine version bumped 2 → 3. Verified
so far only by the unit suite and a throwaway pixel-diff harness (spec §1/§6) — no
owner run through the shipped Export tab or Transfers yet.

- Real-data export: LDN 1272 (OSC ZWO ASI2600MC Duo + mono ATR2600M,
  `~/Pictures/LDN1272`) through the Export tab in **Calibrated lights** mode,
  spot-compared against the external-reference calibrated/debayered outputs already
  collected for spec §1/§6 under the same directory (the reference calibrated pair
  and the `debayered/` folder, log `20260830105156.log`): math stays at float32
  rounding (as the throwaway harness already found), the VNG output matches the
  reference debayer within tolerance (no checkerboard/color-swap, small p99.9
  residual on interior pixels — bitwise equality is not expected), and the
  `ATH_CHPX` hot-pixel counts land near the reference's ~0.24%-of-pixels figure.
  This is the first run through the real UI (gate sentences, the two toggles, the
  `"calibrating"` progress phase) rather than the unit/harness path.
- Two-instance smoke: frame-set send in **Calibrated lights** mode (Transfers) —
  the masters-built gate blocks/unblocks the same way the Export tab does,
  generation runs during the `preparing` phase (not a copy), the receiver lands
  `c_*.fits`/`c_*_d.fits` with no catalog row at all, and re-sending after a
  re-calibration lands `c_*_2.fits` beside the first copy instead of replacing it
  (expected — see the release-note caveat below, not a bug to file).

#### Follow-ups surfaced by review (not smokes)

- **Collab publish rework — its own cycle.** Publishing a device's own lights is
  currently blocked unconditionally (spec §8a, decision C: the project gate's
  `LightCalStatus` resolves to `NotCalibrated` for every frame, so
  `publish_collab_frames` always fails with "no publishable frames"). The rework
  is generate-at-publish with a masters-built gate, mirroring this cycle's export
  gate. It must also un-ignore the 9 collab tests `#[ignore]`d pending it
  (`api/collab.rs` ×7, `api/collab_e2e_tests.rs` ×2, all tagged "collab publish
  rework pending — calibrated-export-v2 spec §8a") — they were rewritten to assert
  the blocked behavior, not deleted, specifically so the rework has something to
  flip back.
- CFA-mismatch advisories (light vs. master Bayer phase) used to surface through
  the old standalone dialog's readiness call; that dialog is gone and nothing
  replaced the surface — the per-frame engine-side logging still runs, but the
  set-level warning reaches no UI. Follow-up: add a `cfa_warnings` field to
  `ExportReadiness` (or the export summary) so Coverage/Export can show it again.
- Old `c_*` trees left under the Calibration Library root by the retired
  standalone flow are uncataloged leftovers on disk — this cycle deliberately does
  not migrate or delete them (spec §2). Manual cleanup, at the owner's
  convenience, whenever the library root gets tidied.
- `sync_prepare::spawn_prepare` holds the ONE staging slot for the WHOLE
  generation phase of a calibrated-lights send (minutes, not seconds) — a
  second send meanwhile sits in `preparing` at 0 bytes with no progress event
  of its own (fixed in the review-fix wave: it now announces itself with the
  row's known byte total before trying for the slot, and again before trying
  for the compute slot, so the wait itself is visible). The model-level
  question — a separate generation slot, or resolving generation before the
  staging slot — is still open and is an owner call.
- A flat deleted between readiness and preparation (the race window C-2 does
  not close) fails inside `resolve_generation_cached`'s norm-divisor read with
  a generic decode error rather than the C-2 "master file missing on disk"
  sentence — the failure is still early and non-partial, and readiness
  catches the case up front, so this is a message downgrade in a narrow race
  window only. A per-frame stat between `resolve_frame_inputs` and the
  divisor computation would close it.
- `get_export_readiness` resolves masters per LIGHT with no per-set
  memoization (`lights.rs:186-200`): a 500-light set runs `resolve_master` up
  to ~1500 times for a handful of shared sets, on a UI path called on every
  dialog open and mode switch. A `HashMap<i64, Option<String>>` memo would
  cut it to one query per set. Deferred out of this wave by the minimal-scope
  constraint.
- The failed-regeneration sibling sweep (`file_organizer.rs`, review fix #5)
  only clears the OPPOSITE-toggle output (`c_x_d.fits` when this run just
  failed to write `c_x.fits`). A previous run's SAME-name output
  (`c_x.fits` already on disk, this run fails to regenerate `c_x.fits`) is
  left untouched, and WBPP would ingest that stale artifact. Pre-existing
  (not introduced by this wave), out of its scope; a fix would need the
  failure arm to also remove `dest` itself when it already exists from an
  earlier run.

### Transfer preparation + single-copy footprint (2026-08-30)

Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-30-transfer-prepare-and-footprint-design.md`.

- Send a ≥ 20 GB object from this Mac: the dialog closes in < 1 s, the row reads
  `preparing · 300 files · X / Y · speed`, Cancel mid-way removes the row's dir,
  a fresh send prepares while a second one waits in `preparing` at 0 B.
- After confirm, `<packages>/<uuid>` is manifest-only and `blobs/` on the Mac
  stays in the tens of MB (outboards only).
- Receive on the pod (ext4): `du blobs/` drops to KB right after export, landed
  files share inodes with `staging/` until confirm, storage card matches `du`.
- Kill the app mid-preparation: on relaunch the row is `failed — preparation
  interrupted`, its dir is gone.
- Settings → Transfers: move both folders, restart, send + receive again;
  Storage shows the leftovers in the old folder and Clean up frees them.
- Perseus resend against the same receiver still lands (Copy path untouched).

#### Follow-ups surfaced by review (not smokes)

- `set_transfer_paths` has no "keep this one" value on the wire (`Option<String>`
  means set-or-reset), so the UI resends the other folder's configured value and
  the backend re-validates it (`create_dir_all` + write probe). An unreachable
  working folder therefore blocks an outgoing-only change — with an honest
  message, on the right card.
- `fetch_collection_multi`'s Copy-export loop has no stale-target guard (Task 7
  deferred it): a swarm retry into the same staging path could hit the self-copy
  truncation if a collab package ever shares a hash with a push-path package now
  referenced in place. The guard is `export_child`'s — delete the complete staged
  children on every retry.
- An `announced` row's bar sits at the 0.95 cap it inherited from the final
  indexing byte count; speed and ETA are correctly suppressed there.
- `cleanup_finished_transfers` (Settings → Transfers → Clean up) removes terminal
  payload dirs without a `protect_shared_before_cleanup` pass — under
  `TryReference` a live sibling package sharing a byte-identical child can
  transiently lose its winning external path (self-heals: the next serve's
  readability probe Copy-re-imports it; it takes a manual click while a
  shared-content transfer is live). Fast-follow: run the protect hook per
  terminal package before its dir is removed.

### Sender counter subtracts the peer's duplicates (2026-08-30)

`TransferFileCounts` grew `duplicate` / `duplicateBytes` (files settled
`done`/`duplicate` at negotiate — the §D4 want-subset exclusion — plus ack-time
ingest duplicates). The send-side row subtracts them from files AND bytes, so it
counts what the receiver counts. Verified against the live sender DB for the
LDN 1272 transfer (562 files, 262 already on the peer): the new `GROUP BY`
returns `duplicate=262`, `duplicate_bytes=13.65 GB`; the confirmed sibling
transfer reports its 8 ingest-time duplicates the same way. Not yet seen on a
running build:

- Re-send an object the peer partly holds: the Transfers row reads
  `N of M files · X / Y · K already on peer` where `M` and `Y` match the
  receiver's own `of M` and total; the progress bar reaches 95% at upload end,
  not ~53%.
- The sidebar Transfers panel shows the same `N of M`, with `K already on peer`
  in the tooltip.
- After confirm, the history row reads `M files · Y · K already on peer`; a fully
  duplicate send reads `0 files · 0 B · K already on peer` next to the existing
  "Peer already had every file" banner in the detail pane.
- Received rows are unchanged (`80 of 300` stays `80 of 300`).

### Frame-set send (2026-08-28) — two-instance smoke

Real object with a raw dark set, a master flat, and a few calibrated lights; second
instance on the same account as the receiver.

- Export tab shows four modes with file counts; `Lights + masters` is disabled with
  "Build masters first — 1 set without a master" and → Coverage lands on that set.
- Build the master on Coverage, return: the radio enables without a reload.
- Send each of the four modes; on the receiver the batch folder opens in WBPP as-is
  (`camera_<x>/BIAS_/DARKS_/FLAT_/lights`), calibrated batch = `camera_<x>/lights/c_*.fits`
  only.
- Receiver Equipment shows the received master as imported (no Rebuild), the raw dark
  set exists with all members.
- Receiver: with the source light also received earlier, the light shows *calibrated*;
  without it, only the file is on disk and the log says "deferred".
- Re-send the calibrated batch: all files report duplicate, no `_2` copies.
- Export to WBPP in `Lights + masters` with a raw set linked is refused with the same
  sentence the tab shows.
- The → Coverage link from a *flat* (or bias) set without a master lands on the matching
  library with that set highlighted, not the Dark library.
- Lights Analysis tab (2026-08-30): no *Send to…* button; with nothing selected the
  Blink button reads *Blink all* and blinks every displayed frame; Shift-click on a
  row (or its checkbox) selects the range from the last plain click in the displayed
  order, and a re-sort between the two clicks does not move the range.

#### Follow-ups surfaced by review (not smokes)

- Receiver dedup for calibrated artifacts is by `sync_receipts` content hash alone
  (spec §4.1), so a deleted received `c_*.fits` is never re-receivable on that
  receiver — a spec property to ratify or revisit.
- A resend after a failed post-ingest calibration-set integration does not retry the
  integration (the receipt-reuse short-circuit leaves the inserted-frames list empty;
  only the `sync_events` journal records it).
- Pre-existing, not this cycle: `cargo check -p athenaeum-core --no-default-features
  --tests` fails (~40 errors in integration tests that use `render`/`solver`-gated
  modules unconditionally); the lib target is green headless. Worth a separate ticket.
- A re-sent artifact whose identity is already tracked at another path is dropped as a
  duplicate — the receiver's existing artifact wins, so re-sending a RE-calibrated light
  does not replace it (spec §4.1; pinned by
  `calibrated_light_already_tracked_is_dropped_as_duplicate`).
- App-shell retention removed 2026-08-29 (owner ruling) — `sync_sources` table is
  vestigial; drop it in a future schema pass.

### Hash cleanup — 2026-08-28

The catalog carried four hashes with three producers for one of them. First task
landed: `files.metadata_hash` (`size + mtime + filename`, the pre-2026-08-27
duplicate key) was write-only since the header key replaced it — no SQL, no
frontend consumer, an index maintained on every insert for nothing — so column,
index, `File.metadata_hash`, `compute_metadata_hash` and the never-read setting
key `duplicates.content_hash_rescanned` are gone. Existing catalogs lose the
column on the next start (`DROP INDEX` then `DROP COLUMN`, guarded on
`pragma_table_info`, rows untouched). Spec D2 of
`2026-08-27-duplicate-detection-design.md` was corrected: its stated reader
(`has_duplicate`) never read the column.

- First launch on the production catalog: the log carries one
  `dropped write-only column` line, `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pragma_table_info('files')
  WHERE name='metadata_hash'` is 0, and the second launch logs nothing.
- Files page, Missing-metadata view and the Duplicates view open and list
  frames — the shared file+frame projection lost a column and every index
  after it moved down by one.
- A scan of a root with changed files still re-parses them in place
  (`files.id` preserved) — the in-place UPDATE lost a parameter.

Then the rest of the cycle: one full-hash function (`package::xxh3_full_file`,
4 MiB reads; `duplicates::compute_full_xxhash` gone), sync banks every full
read into `strong_hash` (sender manifest, receiver confirm, ingest — via
`db::bank_strong_hash`, under `disk_matches_row`), and the scan never hashes
content any more: the content-index job is the one bulk producer, its autostart
gate is `sync_configured || use_content_hash`, and a USER-started scan clears
the cancel latch (the monitor cycle does not). Settings shows one "Content
index" card; the Folders rail has a "Build content index" button.

- Two-instance round trip: after a send lands, `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM files
  WHERE strong_hash IS NOT NULL` grew on BOTH sides by the number of files
  transferred; re-send the same selection — the receiver's log carries
  `dedup responder confirmed candidate full hashes` with `reused = N` and
  `banked = 0`, and no full reads happen.
- Content grouping ON, sync signed out: run a Rescan — the job card appears
  after the scan and the Duplicates view (content mode) shows the new files
  once it finishes. Cancel the job, Rescan again — it comes back; cancel,
  wait for a monitor cycle — it does not.
- A large re-scan on the NAS with content grouping ON is as fast as with it
  OFF (the scan reads headers only either way).
- Settings → General: a single "Content index" card; nothing on the page still
  claims scans hash files as they go. Folders → rail button shows the pending
  count, spins while indexing, reads "All files indexed" at zero.
- Web-backend parity: the web scan route re-arms the job the same way.

### Deep verify banks its reads, and survives a rules change — 2026-08-27

Two fixes in one pass. (1) The verify loop now carries a run-generation token:
changing the keep rules or refreshing the view mid-verify actually stops the
loop instead of hiding the UI while the disks kept grinding and a phantom
"done" summary resurfaced minutes later (reset also un-cancelled a pending
cancel). (2) `verify_duplicate_pair` (both backends) replaces the path-based
compare for the Duplicates view: an identical pair's full-content hash is
computed DURING the byte compare (zero extra I/O — one stream feeds xxh3, and
equal bytes share the digest) and banked into `files.strong_hash` for every
row still current on disk; the next verify of that pair is decided from the
stored hashes without reading either file. A mismatch still early-exits and
stores nothing. Staleness contract shared with the master-hash pass
(`disk_matches_row`); its unreachable-volume log dropped warn→debug.

- Start verify, change a keep rule mid-run: the progress UI disappears AND
  the logs go quiet (no further `verify_duplicate_pair` spans) — previously
  they streamed on for the whole queue.
- Verify a large selection twice: the second run finishes near-instantly
  (stored-hash path), and `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM files WHERE strong_hash IS
  NOT NULL` grows after the first run by roughly the verified-files count.
- Cancel mid-run still lands the `cancelled` summary with partial counts.
- A verified pair, then one file re-saved (mtime drift): the next verify of
  that pair falls back to reading bytes (stale row disqualifies the shortcut).

### Duplicate detection keyed on header identity — 2026-08-27

The cheap duplicate key stopped being `files.metadata_hash`
(`size + mtime + filename`, where mtime is a property of the copy) and became
`(fits_header.header_fingerprint, files.size, files.filename)` restricted to raw
sub-frames.
Spec: `specs/2026-08-27-duplicate-detection-design.md`. On the owner's
production catalog the view returned 0 groups while holding 2 750
(5 552 files, 170.5 GiB) across 33 calibration sets.

- Open the Duplicates view on the production catalog: ~2 750 groups appear,
  including the twenty pairs in calibration set 628.
- No group mixes two filters. Spot-check any `C_2022_E3_ZTF_Light_*` or
  `IC_2087_Light_*` name — those files repeat across filter folders with the
  same size and must NOT be grouped.
- Master groups contain only byte-identical files: `Pane_2_Sii.xisf` /
  `Pane_2_Ha.xisf` (identical headers, different filters) never group, and
  neither do the `masterDark_BIN-1_…` near-copies that differ by ~12 bytes of
  XML header. NB: on this catalog every sampled master pair proved
  byte-DIFFERENT, so ZERO master groups is a legitimate — and expected —
  outcome; the smoke is that no wrong group appears, not that groups do.
- After the scan, `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM files WHERE strong_hash IS NOT NULL`
  is ~61 (the header-shortlisted masters), not 381 and not 41 893. ~61 may read
  high: the shortlist query does not gate on the Black Hole or on
  `scan_roots.find_duplicates`, so it can hash a few masters the view would
  never offer. Order of magnitude is the check, not the exact number.
- A processed derivative is not offered as a copy of its source: `Lum.xisf` and
  `Lum_GraXpert.xisf` (same header, same size, different bytes) must NOT be a
  group, and `Find duplicate folders` must not score a folder of processed
  outputs as similar to the folder it came from.
- Run a scan: the post-scan rebuild fills `duplicate_groups` with
  `hash_type = 'header'` and the second open of the view is instant.
- Turn on content grouping with an empty content index: the view goes empty
  rather than erroring, and the Settings text points at the index.
- `Find duplicate folders` scores the two copies of a flats folder as similar.

### Membership counters follow deletions — 2026-08-27

`calibration_set.frame_count` and `sessions.frame_count`/`total_exp_time` were written
only where members are *added*; a deletion arrives by FK cascade, where there was no
call site to hook, so the counters froze at their creation-time value. Owner report:
sets 546/547 showing 20 with 10 members left, 628 showing 80 with 40. Fixed with
`AFTER INSERT`/`AFTER DELETE` triggers on both junction tables plus a startup resync
sweep in `init_db` (`db/schema.rs::create_membership_count_sync_triggers` /
`resync_membership_counts`). On the owner's production catalog the sweep corrects 868
calibration sets and 42 sessions — verified on a copy, not yet run in the app.

- Launch on the production catalog: Equipment page shows real member counts on
  546/547 (10) and 628 (40); the log line `membership counters resynced from junction
  tables` reports `calibration_sets=868 sessions=42`, and a second launch reports
  nothing (the sweep only rewrites rows that actually differ).
- Delete calibration frames through the Black Hole → void: the owning set's count
  drops immediately, and a set that loses its last member is still pruned.
- Object-set session rows show frame counts and integration times matching their
  members after a deletion.

### Code-debt cleanup — 2026-08-25

Dead enum variants deleted (`WarningType` ×3, `SkipReason` ×2, `StepStatus::RolledBack`
in both `file_op` and `archive` — git history confirms none was ever constructed, so no
DB row can hold the removed strings), `api/` rustfmt pass, and a **Rebuild master**
button in the provenance block of `CalibrationSetTable`.

- Rebuild a built master from the library UI: progress rides the raw set's building
  state, one "Master created" notification at the end, provenance block refreshes
  (new Created timestamp) without collapsing the row.
- The button is disabled with a "restore originals first" hint on a master whose
  originals are archived and gone from disk; Restore originals → Rebuild works.
- An imported master shows no Rebuild button at all (provenance block says
  "imported master").
- Export warnings panel still renders temperature/age/missing warnings after the
  `WarningType` trim.

### Big-catalog performance — committed 2026-08-22, authored 2026-08-11

Unindexed foreign-key child columns, `IN (…)` lists past SQLite's bind-parameter
ceiling, a WAL transaction that read before it wrote, ghost master sets, and a
Duplicates view that put every group in the DOM at once.

- ~~Remove a large scan root.~~ **Done 2026-08-22: 2.41 s, against 45.8 minutes before.** Three of the four defects sit on that one path.
- Duplicates screen on a catalog that mirrors one library across several drives — it opens instead of failing; "Show 500 more" grows the list; the Black Hole count covers every group, not just the visible ones.
- After removing a root, the Master Dark/Flat library and the calibration matcher hold no master whose file is gone (39 such ghosts survived the old delete).
- `PRAGMA integrity_check` after the removal, and masters still in use survived it.

### Content index — 2026-08-11

`content_hash` is built by one visible, cancellable background job gated on sync
being configured. *(Since the 2026-08-28 hash cleanup: the scan never hashes at
all — the opt-in scan-time path is gone — and the gate also opens when content
grouping is on; see that section for the re-arm rules.)*

- Scan the 18 946-file root signed **out** — seconds rather than ~40 s, `content_hash` stays NULL, no job card.
- Sign in and relaunch — the card appears, progresses, finishes with one notification, `pending` reaches 0.
- Press the card's X mid-pass, then let a **monitor cycle** scan — **it must not come back.** (A scan the user starts by hand DOES bring it back since 2026-08-28 — that is the hash-cleanup check, not this one.)
- A catalog holding an archived frame set — a permanent non-zero remainder that the card explains without inviting a pointless retry.
- Settings → "Build index now" while signed **out** — runs anyway (the manual path is ungated) and clears any suppression.
- Start a master build and "Build index now" together — they queue rather than run concurrently (`compute.max_concurrent` defaults to 1).
- Web-backend parity for both routes.

### Dev/prod data separation — 2026-08-09

Debug builds resolve a `.dev` app-data sibling; `npm run dev:db-refresh` snapshots the
production catalog into it.

- `npm run tauri dev` — About shows the `.dev` DB path, the app is signed out, and no sync-receiver startup events appear in log-mcp.
- The production app is untouched after a dev session.
- log-mcp shows both trees (needs a Claude session restart, since the server is `cargo run`).
- `ATHENAEUM_APP_DATA_DIR=<prod dir> npm run tauri dev` opens the production catalog.
- `dev:db-refresh` on a machine with a **real populated catalog**. **Caveat:** the production DB on the dev Mac is empty — 53 tables, `files = 0` — so every real-data check during that cycle was vacuous and the script's row semantics were proven only in a sandbox.

### CFA / sync / archive / web fixes — 2026-08-04

- Web archive — the widget auto-dismisses and the page reloads.
- The resume banner shows progress, and resuming an all-Done operation still retires the banner.
- Web sky-map rectangle select returns candidates (it returned 422 on every selection before).
- Two-device OSC sync — `bayerpat` is non-NULL on the receiver. Every synced frame previously landed with NULL CFA columns, silently disabling per-channel flat scaling on the peer.
- An existing catalog back-fills on first start — `query_logs` for `"cfa columns back-filled from stored headers"`.
- A cancelled resume reports `rolled_back`, not `failed`.

### Dead / duplicate code cleanup — 2026-08-04

- Rollback progress is visible from the archive resume banner.
- Calibration tables click-through: sort flip, the Bias table's reversed B, G, O order, hammer → "building…" pulse.
- Three queue indicators in the sidebar.

### DB hygiene and transaction discipline — 2026-08-03

Six Critical findings across the SQLite layer, including SQL injection in
`get_black_hole_files` reachable from the web backend. The five-item smoke list is in
`plans/2026-08-03-db-hygiene-hardening.md`; the audit is
`research/2026-08-03-db-layer-audit.md`.

Two facts from that audit are worth not re-deriving: foreign-key enforcement is on
everywhere, because the bundled `libsqlite3-sys` compiles with
`-DSQLITE_DEFAULT_FOREIGN_KEYS=1`; and CASCADE deletes do fire after `AFTER DELETE`
triggers, verified empirically.

### OSC / CFA hardening — 2026-08-03

- Real OSC subs → inspect the master's Bayer cards.
- Calibrate with per-channel flat scaling on versus off, compared visually.
- The mono-flat advisory appears.
- A rescan picks up an edited `BAYERPAT`. Rows written before the fix carry `Some("")` and self-heal on rescan.

### Calibration supersede-hardening — 2026-08-02

Consolidated list in the audit's "Post-cycle follow-ups"
(`research/2026-08-02-calibration-audit.md`). A Windows smoke is owed for the
filename-claim and rename path. Note that `LIGHT_CAL_ENGINE_VERSION` went 1 → 2, so
every previously calibrated light derives *stale* — intended, and a release note is
owed for it.

### Cross-platform path fixes — 2026-07-30

The compile gate cleared with the v0.5.1 tag (2026-08-24) — see the audit doc's
Status section. What remains is the manual smoke list:

- Restore-to-original, Windows, end to end.
- A move across a Docker bind mount (EXDEV), killed mid-copy, then resumed.
- Windows beta catalogs that ran a relink before the fix may hold `\\?\`-spelled `scan_roots` / `files` rows and need re-adding or relinking.
- `mt.exe` manifest validation, and a path longer than 260 characters.
- A UNC breadcrumb click.
- The new `delete_archive` failure message.
- A Linux archive plan over case-only-distinct roots is refused loudly.

### Folders screen redesign — 2026-07-30

The eleven-item checklist in `plans/2026-07-29-folders-screen-redesign.md`, plus three
from the minors fix wave: an unknown-kind row stays visible; a toggle failure raises a
dialog rather than a banner; the tinted checkbox renders. The artfrom.space guide still
describes the old tab name.

### Shipped in v0.5.0-beta.1, still unconfirmed

Transfers v2 and the batch model (U1–U8, two instances), D3 multi-source distribution
(three devices), transfer concurrency W1 + W2 (four scenarios), Perseus UI v2, the
Windows path fixes (five scenarios), and the mirror hierarchy (five). Checklists live
in the plans beside this file. The per-task `progress-*.md` execution ledgers are in
`.superpowers/sdd/`, which is gitignored — they exist only on the machine that ran the
cycle, so anything from them that matters later belongs here or in a plan.

## Awaiting a call from the owner

- **D1–D4 from the DB-layer audit.** Single process per catalog file (proposed: ratify); keep the pool-exhaustion panic (proposed: keep); executor per-stage connections (proposed: defer); same-volume rename reconcile (proposed: defer, since the scanner heals it in practice).
- **The archive banner wedge.** Banner buttons are disabled for as long as the resume/rollback widget lives, so a lost terminal event — a narrow listen-registration race, or a worker panic — wedges the banner until reload. No data is lost. Accept it, or add a bounded escape that re-enables the controls on a timeout.
- **Auto-link deselect semantics**, and whether a "manual block" concept is wanted.
- **`frames.is_master` without `is_master_library`** — what shape that takes in the archive.
- **Header fingerprint as the transfer-dedup Offer key** (hash-cleanup follow-up,
  2026-08-28, NOT started). The content index exists only to give the RECEIVER a
  cheap "do I have this?" membership key — the sender computes its sampling hash
  from the staged copy — and `fits_header.header_fingerprint` is already 100 %
  populated there at zero I/O. Carrying the fingerprint in the Offer (a new
  `Msg` variant; indices are frozen, append-only; Perseus already parses headers
  through `athenaeum-core`) would retire `content_hash`, the index job and the
  Settings card, with the full-hash confirm unchanged as the safety net. A
  mismatch (WCS written into one copy, parser drift between versions) costs a
  re-transfer, never a loss. A protocol cycle of its own; proposed: defer.
- **The full analysis path under-reports eccentricity on trailed frames**
  (full detail: `docs/backlog-v0.5.6.md` item 4). The full detector's shape
  stamp (`1.5 × field FWHM`) is self-reinforcing on a streak's small-FWHM
  bright head — measured 0.56 where the fast path (stamp follows the star's
  own size, `2 × HFD`) sees 0.88 on the same real frame. Consequence: the
  Analysis table rates a badly-trailed frame well, and the plate-solve input
  gate (which reads this number) misses it — plate-solving itself is not
  fooled, it re-measures shape at its own scale. Not the maths that's open:
  changing the stamp changes `median_eccentricity` for every frame already
  catalogued, so the open call is the re-analysis story (bulk re-analysis pass
  vs. the two measurements coexisting for a while). Branch
  `feature/star-detection-fix` exists in both repos, **not pushed**.
- **One place to watch what the app is doing** (full detail:
  `docs/backlog-v0.5.6.md` item 5). Progress today is scattered per feature:
  the sidebar `ComputeQueueIndicator` lists `running`/`queued` only, no
  stage/percent; a master build's stage and percent render nowhere but a 10px
  table cell on the Coverage tab; Analysis, transfers, scan, export and
  archive each own a separate widget. Owner's 2026-09-07 verdict: current
  state acceptable for now, not blocking. Open: sidebar slide-over vs. a page;
  whether `ComputeQueueEntry` growing a subject id (enough to join an existing
  progress stream) is sufficient on its own; whether the per-feature widgets
  fold into it or stay as they are.
- **Duplicate cache rebuild is quadratic, unthrottled, and runs
  unconditionally on every scan** (full detail: `docs/backlog-v0.5.6.md` item
  9, raised 2026-09-16). Scan Phase 4 (`scanner/mod.rs:1941-2015`) rebuilds
  the *entire* duplicate-groups cache — twice, once per `DuplicateKey::Header`
  and once per `DuplicateKey::Master`, each a full recompute with a separate
  prepared statement and row-by-row insert per duplicate group — plus the
  O(folders²) folder-similarity pass, on **every** scan, gated only on
  `!result.cancelled` (no check for "nothing changed"). This includes
  unattended monitor polls every 10 minutes (`MONITORING_INTERVAL_MINUTES`,
  default), whose own doc comment assumes an unchanged re-scan is "effectively
  free" — true for the file walk, not for this phase.
  `duplicates/backfill.rs::fill_master_strong_hashes` also runs synchronous,
  single-threaded, unthrottled full-file hashing on the scan's own thread,
  unlike its sibling `run_content_index`, which is deliberately chunked and
  throttled to protect the app's IO. Diagnosis only — no fix shape chosen, no
  per-phase timing measured yet on a large catalog. Candidates worth
  evaluating once measured: skip Phase 4 when nothing changed and no stale
  duplicate rows exist; background/throttle `fill_master_strong_hashes` the
  way `run_content_index` already is; make the cache rebuild incremental
  instead of a full recompute; replace the O(folders²) folder-similarity
  comparison with an indexed SQL join.
- **A symlink-crossing scan root logs as flatly "not resolvable", with no hint
  it was a symlink.** Raised by the owner 2026-09-17. `check_scan_root_overlap`
  (`api/scan_roots.rs:340-345`) calls `Path::canonicalize()` on every existing
  scan root, which walks and resolves every symlink on the path; when a root
  (or an intermediate component) crosses a symlink whose target volume is
  momentarily unmounted, this fails with a bare `No such file or directory (os
  error 2)` and falls back to comparing by the stored path — correct, and
  already handled gracefully — but the WARN gives no way to tell "the whole
  root is offline" apart from "a symlink further down the chain briefly lost
  its target". Observed on `/Volumes/Universe/Astrophotography`: WARNs on
  2026-09-14/15, then the same root scanned successfully (5611 found) on
  2026-09-16 — confirms it was the symlink target coming and going, not the
  root itself, an intermittent condition rather than a defect. Open: worth
  teaching the WARN to name the first unresolvable path component and whether
  it is a symlink (`std::fs::symlink_metadata` per component, or
  `std::fs::read_link` on the failing segment), so this reads as "symlink
  target N unavailable" instead of an unqualified "root offline" — not
  researched into a concrete diff yet.

---

## Release notes owed at the next tag

(The v0.5.1–v0.6.1 lines were paid at their own tags — the Blink full-resolution debayer,
the cache limit, the plate-solve gate controls, the master-deletion un-supersede, the
scan-error reveal and **Check again** at v0.5.6; the **Lights + calibration sets** raw
originals and the role-folder missing files at v0.6.0. Nothing is owed after v0.6.2.)
