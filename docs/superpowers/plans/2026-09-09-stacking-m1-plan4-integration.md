# Stacking M1 — Plan 4: combiner v2, weighted engine, headers, Checkpoint B

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Turn registered, measured, weighted frames into a master light — weighted combination with survivor masks and rejection maps, global normalization, the spec's Auto rejection rule, a WCS card writer, the master-light card set and file naming — and prove it on the owner's data against the external masters (**Checkpoint B**).

**Architecture:** The banded engine keeps one band loop (reads, progress, cancel, timing) and grows a second per-pixel path: every sample is range-checked, rejection-normalized for the rejection algorithm, output-normalized for the combination, weighted, and its survival recorded in a per-pixel bit mask from which rejection maps and per-frame rejected fractions are accumulated. The four rejection algorithms are made generic over the sample type so the index-carrying variant is the same code as the master builder's — masters stay byte-identical. A group driver runs the engine once per plane through `RegisteredSource`, measures the master, and hands planes + maps + stats to a writer that builds the master-light header (copy-through, WCS from the reference's plate solve, provenance) and the §9.5 file name.

**Tech Stack:** Rust (no new crate dependencies), the existing `integration`/`resample`/`geometry`/`stacking` modules, `fits_writer`, `plate_solve::storage::PlateSolveRecord`, `serde`, `tracing`.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-08-stacking-pipeline-design.md` (§5.1, §6, §9.2, §9.5, §13, §14 M1 items 7–8). **Math:** `docs/superpowers/research/2026-09-08-stacking-math-reference.md` §3. **Previous checkpoint:** `docs/superpowers/research/2026-09-09-checkpoint-a-registration.md`.

## Rulings made while writing this plan

1. **Masters stay byte-identical by construction, not by a second copy of the algorithms.** The four rejection routines in `combine.rs` become generic over a `Sample` trait (`f32` and `(f32, u16)`); `combine_pixel` keeps calling them with `f32` — same monomorphized code, same results — and the new `combine_pixel_weighted` calls them with index-carrying pairs. A pin test runs both on 2000 random stacks with unit weights and identity normalization and demands bit equality.
2. **Linear-fit dispersion parity lands here (spec §6.3).** `reject_linear_fit` adopts `s = 2·adev·sqrt(1 + b²)` (math reference §3.4). No master recipe auto-selects linear fit, so only an explicitly linear-fit master changes; the affected unit tests are re-pinned in the same task with the measured values and the reason.
3. **The survivor mask is caller-owned scratch** (`&mut [u64]`, `ceil(n/64)` words per pixel), not a heap-allocated type: the engine holds one per row worker. Low/high classification of a rejected sample: below the survivors' median of the rejection-normalized values → low, otherwise high (the reference counts the two sides separately; this is the side each algorithm rejected on, recovered after the fact without threading a side through every routine).
4. **Range rejection belongs to the engine, counts in the maps.** `raw ≤ rangeLow` (on by default at 0.0) and `raw ≥ rangeHigh` (off by default; 0.98 when on) are rejected before normalization and counted low/high — the reference's `mapRangeRejection = true`. NaN samples (no coverage) are neither rejected nor counted: they are missing, as today.
5. **One band loop.** `run_banded`'s read/progress/cancel/timing skeleton is extracted into `band_loop` with a per-band combine closure; the master path and the stacking path are two closures. The existing engine tests (cancel points, progress monotonicity, bytes accounting, flats) are the pin for the extraction.
6. **Rejection maps are counts** (spec §6.2), f32 planes written as `<master stem>_rejlow.fits` / `_rejhigh.fits` when `writeRejectionMaps` is on; the external maps are fractions (`count / n`) — the checkpoint divides ours by `n` to compare.
7. **`IMAGETYP` of a master light is the writer's existing `FrameKind::MasterLight` string (`Master Light`)**, not the spec's `'MASTER LIGHT'` — one convention for every master the app writes; the spec is corrected in Task 6.
8. **`ATH_STKID` is nine characters — FITS keywords are eight.** The run-id card is `ATH_STKI`; the spec is corrected in Task 6.
9. **CRPIX is 1-based on the card, 0-based in the record.** `PlateSolveRecord.crpix*` follows the solver (0-based pixel coordinates, `x − crpix`); the FITS card gets `crpix + 1`. SIP: `A_ORDER`/`B_ORDER` + `A_i_j`/`B_i_j` (and `AP_`/`BP_` when the reverse exists) from the stored `Vec<Vec<f64>>` (`coeffs[i][j]` for `u^i v^j`, i + j ≤ order); `CTYPE` gains the `-SIP` suffix only when SIP cards are written.
10. **The stacking rejection config is its own type** (`RejectionChoice`, camelCase per spec §9.2, with `auto`) that resolves to the master builder's `Rejection` (snake_case, `tag = "method"`) per group size: n < 8 → percentile 0.2/0.1; 8 ≤ n < 20 → Winsorized 4.0/3.0; n ≥ 20 → linear fit 5.0/3.5 (spec §6.3).
11. **Weights enter the engine per plane** as `FrameWeight.normalized[plane]` (Plan 2's per-channel max-normalized weights); a frame whose minimum channel weight is below `minWeight` (0.005) is dropped from the group before integration, and a group below 3 frames is refused (math reference §3.7).
12. **Normalization pairs come from stage-3 measurements** (`ChannelMeasurement::location_scale()` per channel, spec §5.1) — the driver computes `rejection_pair`/`output_pair` (Plan 2's `integration::stats`) against the reference's measurement; `RejectionNormalization::Local` is refused in M1 with a named error.
13. **The Checkpoint B comparison reads the `integration` image of the external master XISF** — that file holds three images (`integration`, `rejection_low`, `rejection_high`); the probe asserts the first image's `id` before comparing. The external light integrations used **local** rejection normalization (LN, M2) with additive-with-scaling output normalization and linear fit 5.0/3.5; ours uses `scaleZeroOffset` — the noise target (±5 %) still applies, the rejected-fraction target (1–4 %) is read against 2.831 % (mono) / 2.51–2.79 % (OSC).
14. **The external log's timestamps are UTC, file mtimes local (+3 h)**: the masters of run `20260908121336` are the `_(1)` files (`masterLight_…mono_(1).xisf` 16:49 local = 13:49 UTC in the log).
15. **`MRS_LAYER0_GAIN` is renamed `MRS_LAYER1_GAIN`** (Plan 2 carry-forward: the estimator's doc says layer 1) in the same task that first cites it in a checkpoint number.

## Rulings made during execution (2026-09-09)

- **Task 2 — linear-fit dispersion is `2·adev`, not `2·adev·sqrt(1 + b²)`.**
  The reviewer showed the slope term is dimensionally valid only on [0, 1]
  input: the master builder feeds `combine_pixel` native ADU, where the
  sorted-rank slope is O(1)…O(10³) and the term inflated the dispersion
  up to three orders of magnitude — an explicitly chosen linear-fit master
  recipe rejected nothing. On [0, 1] stacks the term is inert (factor
  1.000001 at `b ≈ 1e-3`), so dropping it keeps parity where it matters
  and restores the master path; an ADU-scale pin test guards it. The
  OLS-vs-robust-MAD line fit (about one order of magnitude of z margin,
  the +5σ single-outlier band at n = 20) is an M4 item and does not block
  Checkpoint B (n = 208 rejects a 2–3 % population identically to the old
  formula).

- **Task 3 — rejection sides are classified per frame, not by walking `work`.**
  The plan's sketch read the rejected entries back out of `work` after the
  combiner; the rejection routines compact survivors forward destructively,
  so those entries are overwritten (a rejection not in the tail vanished
  from the maps and the per-frame counts while `rejected_fraction` stayed
  right). The engine now keeps the rejection value per frame (`rej_vals`)
  and a `present` mask per pixel and classifies every present-but-unmasked
  frame against the survivors' median (`work[..len − rejected]`). The
  per-sample atomics became per-row flushes (one `fetch_add` per frame per
  row). A regression test puts the outlier in frame 0 under a sorting
  algorithm, and a multi-band maps-on test pins the global row offset.

## Carry-forwards taken up here (from Plans 1–3)

- Plan 1: `read_rows_with_scratch` gets its consumer — `RegisteredSource` workers reuse a byte scratch and an f32 window buffer per worker (Task 3). The warp runs on the caller's rayon context (the injected pool installs it); the "global pool vs injected pool" note is closed by running `warp_rows` inside `pool.install` in the engine (it already is: `read_band_with_progress` is called from the engine thread and its workers are the source's own; no change). Worker panics inside `read_band_with_progress`'s scoped workers propagate as a panic to the build thread's `catch_unwind` (masters) — Plan 5's stacking job uses the same thread pattern; noted, not changed.
- Plan 2: `MRS_LAYER0_GAIN` rename (ruling 15); `background_residual` `data.len() == w·h` precondition added where the checkpoint calls it (Task 7); `winsorize`'s ±∞ guard is a `stacking::robust` matter for M4.
- Plan 3 (for Plan 4): the σ-weighted refit is effectively unweighted (`sx/sy` are PSF widths) — no effect on integration; the domain clamp guarantees bounded displacements everywhere the engine resamples; `Alignment.repaired`/`inlier_ratio`/overlap are not quality evidence after re-pairing (Plan 5's frame table).

## Carry-forwards for Plan 5 (collected as this plan is executed; the executing controller appends)

- Plan 5 owns: `stacking_runs`/`stacking_groups`/… tables, config hash + artifact reuse, the reference's `ROWORDER` and `INSTRUME`-differs flag, `ATH_STKF` (reference identity string) and `ATH_STKI` (run id) values, the copy-through source (the reference's calibrated file), deleting intermediates, events and the tab.

## Global Constraints

- Never name other stacking programs / codebases in code or comments (docs may say "the external stacker"; file formats such as `.xdrz`/`.xisf` may be named).
- Two backends in sync — this plan adds **no** command or route; `athenaeum-tauri`/`athenaeum-web` are untouched. Every new serde type that can reach JSON storage is `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]` with `#[serde(default)]` where old JSON must stay valid.
- `tracing` only; zero `println!`/`eprintln!` outside `#[cfg(test)]` and `examples/`; log messages are short stable phrases with snake_case fields; new field names go into `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-03-logging-overhaul-design.md`'s dictionary in the same task.
- No new crate dependencies; `Cargo.toml` changes only by one `[[example]]` block; `Cargo.lock` unchanged.
- `cargo check -p athenaeum-core --no-default-features` stays clean: `stacking` is gated `all(render, solver)`, `integration` is gated `render`; the new `fits_writer::wcs` is gated `all(render, solver)` like `plate_solve` and `stacking`; the headless check compiles it out.
- Masters byte-identical: every existing `integration` test passes unchanged; the pin test of Task 1 is mandatory.
- rustfmt only on newly created leaf files and on files that are rustfmt-clean before the task (`combine.rs`, `engine.rs`, `registered_source.rs`, `stats.rs` are clean — check with `rustfmt --check` before editing; `banded.rs` and the never-rustfmt list — `mod.rs`, `lib.rs`, `schema.rs`, `scanner/mod.rs`, `registration/db.rs`, `test_support.rs` — are hand-edit only).
- Commits as `git -c user.name=eg013ra1n -c user.email=vilen.sharifov@gmail.com commit` with the two trailers `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>` and `Claude-Session: https://claude.ai/code/session_01DjyxL6wsv1HT5GiXxedbAY`.
- Owner data for the checkpoint (read-only): `~/Pictures/Calibration Test/LDN1272-WBPP/LDN1272-ATH/LDN 1272/camera_atr2600m/lights/c_*.fits` (208 mono) and `camera_zwoasi2600mcduo/lights/c_*_d.fits` (160 OSC); reference `c_2025-10-18_02-02-02__-9.90_180.00s_0073.fits`; external masters `~/Pictures/Calibration Test/LDN1272-Output/master/masterLight_BIN-1_6224x4168_EXPOSURE-180.00s_FILTER-NoFilter_mono_(1).xisf` and `…_RGB_(1).xisf`; log `~/Pictures/Calibration Test/LDN1272-Output/logs/20260908121336.log`.

### Task 1: `combine.rs` — generic rejections, `combine_pixel_weighted`, survivor masks

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/integration/combine.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `IntegrationRecipe`, `Rejection`, `Combination`, the four `reject_*` routines, `sort_asc`, `median_sorted`, `mean` (all in this file).
- Produces: `pub trait Sample`, `pub fn combine_pixel_weighted(work: &mut [(f32, u16)], out_values: &[f32], weights: &[f32], recipe: IntegrationRecipe, mask: &mut [u64], scratch: &mut Vec<f32>) -> (f32, usize)` (the `scratch` parameter was added by the Task 1 fix round — a caller-hoisted survivor-value buffer so the median path allocates nothing per pixel), `pub fn mask_words(n: usize) -> usize`, `pub fn mask_get(mask: &[u64], i: usize) -> bool`, `pub fn mask_clear(mask: &mut [u64])`, `pub fn mask_set(mask: &mut [u64], i: usize)`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Read the file end to end** (`combine.rs`, ~860 lines) — the four routines compact survivors into `values[..kept]` in place and report whether the prefix is sorted; `combine_pixel` combines the prefix. Note every place a value is compared, sorted, summed or clamped.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing pin test** (add to the `tests` module):

```rust
    /// SplitMix64, so the pin needs no dependency.
    fn rng_next(state: &mut u64) -> f64 {
        *state = state.wrapping_add(0x9E37_79B9_7F4A_7C15);
        let mut z = *state;
        z = (z ^ (z >> 30)).wrapping_mul(0xBF58_476D_1CE4_E5B9);
        z = (z ^ (z >> 27)).wrapping_mul(0x94D0_49BB_1331_11EB);
        ((z ^ (z >> 31)) >> 11) as f64 / (1u64 << 53) as f64
    }

    fn random_stack(state: &mut u64, n: usize) -> Vec<f32> {
        (0..n)
            .map(|_| {
                let g = rng_next(state) + rng_next(state) + rng_next(state) - 1.5;
                let outlier = if rng_next(state) < 0.05 { 6.0 * (rng_next(state) - 0.5) } else { 0.0 };
                // Never an exact zero: the weighted path skips zero-valued
                // samples (missing coverage), the plain mean averages them.
                (0.2 + 0.01 * g as f32 + outlier as f32).max(1e-4)
            })
            .collect()
    }

    #[test]
    fn weighted_combiner_with_unit_weights_is_bit_identical_to_combine_pixel() {
        let recipes = [
            IntegrationRecipe::average(Rejection::None),
            IntegrationRecipe::average(Rejection::PercentileClip { low: 0.2, high: 0.1 }),
            IntegrationRecipe::average(Rejection::SigmaClip { sigma_low: 4.0, sigma_high: 3.0 }),
            IntegrationRecipe::average(Rejection::WinsorizedSigma { sigma_low: 4.0, sigma_high: 3.0 }),
            IntegrationRecipe::average(Rejection::LinearFitClip { sigma_low: 5.0, sigma_high: 3.5 }),
            IntegrationRecipe::median(Rejection::SigmaClip { sigma_low: 3.0, sigma_high: 3.0 }),
            IntegrationRecipe::median(Rejection::WinsorizedSigma { sigma_low: 4.0, sigma_high: 3.0 }),
        ];
        let mut state = 0x5EED_1234u64;
        for (k, recipe) in recipes.iter().enumerate() {
            for trial in 0..300 {
                let n = 3 + (trial % 30);
                let stack = random_stack(&mut state, n);
                let mut plain = stack.clone();
                let (v_plain, rej_plain) = combine_pixel(&mut plain, *recipe);
                let mut work: Vec<(f32, u16)> =
                    stack.iter().enumerate().map(|(i, &v)| (v, i as u16)).collect();
                let weights = vec![1.0f32; n];
                let mut mask = vec![0u64; mask_words(n)];
                let (v_w, rej_w) =
                    combine_pixel_weighted(&mut work, &stack, &weights, *recipe, &mut mask);
                assert_eq!(
                    v_plain.to_bits(),
                    v_w.to_bits(),
                    "recipe {k} trial {trial}: {v_plain} vs {v_w}"
                );
                assert_eq!(rej_plain, rej_w, "recipe {k} trial {trial}");
                let survivors = (0..n).filter(|&i| mask_get(&mask, i)).count();
                assert_eq!(survivors, n - rej_w, "recipe {k} trial {trial}");
            }
        }
    }
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run it to see it fail** — `cargo test -p athenaeum-core combine::tests::weighted_combiner` → compile error (no `Sample`, no `combine_pixel_weighted`).

- [ ] **Step 4: The `Sample` trait and the generic routines.** Add near the top of the file:

```rust
/// A stack element the rejection routines can order and read: the plain
/// sample for master builds, a `(value, frame index)` pair for the
/// stacking engine, which needs to know WHICH frames survived.
pub trait Sample: Copy {
    fn value(self) -> f32;
}

impl Sample for f32 {
    #[inline]
    fn value(self) -> f32 {
        self
    }
}

impl Sample for (f32, u16) {
    #[inline]
    fn value(self) -> f32 {
        self.0
    }
}
```

Then make `sort_asc`, `median_sorted`, `mean`, `apply_rejection`, `reject_percentile`, `reject_sigma_clip`, `reject_winsorized` and `reject_linear_fit` generic: `fn f<T: Sample>(values: &mut [T], …)`, every read of a value becomes `values[i].value()`, every comparison sorts by `a.value().total_cmp(&b.value())` — **the same comparator the f32 version uses today** (if today's code uses `partial_cmp(...).unwrap_or(Equal)`, keep exactly that expression on `.value()`; do not change the ordering semantics). Sums and statistics stay `f64`/`f32` exactly as today, reading `.value()`. The winsorized routine's "clamp the working copy but sum the originals" logic must keep both copies as `T` (the clamped copy is `Vec<T>` built by mapping the value — for `(f32, u16)` the index rides along unchanged). `combine_pixel` keeps its signature (`&mut [f32]`) and body — it simply calls the generic routines with `T = f32`. This is the template for one routine; the others follow the same mechanical rule:

```rust
fn reject_sigma_clip<T: Sample>(values: &mut [T], sigma_low: f64, sigma_high: f64) -> (usize, bool) {
    let n = values.len();
    if n < 3 {
        return (n, false);
    }
    let mut kept = n;
    for _ in 0..MAX_REJECTION_ITERS {
        let slice = &values[..kept];
        let m = {
            let mut tmp: Vec<f32> = slice.iter().map(|s| s.value()).collect();
            sort_asc_f32(&mut tmp);
            median_sorted_f32(&tmp) as f64
        };
        let mean = slice.iter().map(|s| s.value() as f64).sum::<f64>() / kept as f64;
        let var = slice.iter().map(|s| (s.value() as f64 - mean).powi(2)).sum::<f64>() / kept as f64;
        let sigma = var.sqrt();
        if sigma == 0.0 {
            break;
        }
        let lo = m - sigma_low * sigma;
        let hi = m + sigma_high * sigma;
        let mut w = 0;
        for r in 0..kept {
            let v = values[r].value() as f64;
            if v >= lo && v <= hi {
                values[w] = values[r];
                w += 1;
            }
        }
        if w == kept {
            break;
        }
        if w == 0 {
            break;
        }
        kept = w;
        if kept < 2 {
            break;
        }
    }
    (kept, false)
}
```

**This template is illustrative of the mechanics, not of the arithmetic**: keep the existing routine's exact arithmetic (its median source, its σ formula, its all-rejected guard, its iteration cap) and only change the element type. If the existing routine sorts the survivors, sort `T` by `.value()`. Keep `sort_asc`/`median_sorted` generic too (`sort_asc<T: Sample>(v: &mut [T])` sorting by `.value()`; `median_sorted<T: Sample>(v: &[T]) -> f32`).

- [ ] **Step 5: Mask helpers and `combine_pixel_weighted`.** Add below `combine_pixel`:

```rust
// ── Survivor masks ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/// Words a survivor mask needs for `n` frames.
#[inline]
pub fn mask_words(n: usize) -> usize {
    n.div_ceil(64)
}

#[inline]
pub fn mask_clear(mask: &mut [u64]) {
    mask.iter_mut().for_each(|w| *w = 0);
}

#[inline]
pub fn mask_set(mask: &mut [u64], i: usize) {
    mask[i / 64] |= 1u64 << (i % 64);
}

#[inline]
pub fn mask_get(mask: &[u64], i: usize) -> bool {
    mask[i / 64] & (1u64 << (i % 64)) != 0
}

/// Weighted combination of one pixel column (spec §6.2, math reference §3.2
/// steps 3, 5, 6).

**Precision contract for the pin:** the existing `mean` must be read to see how it accumulates (f64 sum then cast, or f32). The weighted average above accumulates in f64 with `w = 1.0` exactly, so it is bit-identical to an f64-accumulated mean; if `mean` accumulates in **f32**, change the weighted loop to accumulate `num`/`den` in f32 the same way (`num += x * w; den += w;`) so the pin holds — report which it was. `x != 0.0` skipping is new behaviour relative to `mean` (which averages zeros too): the pin test's fixture never produces exact zeros except through `.max(0.0)` on a negative outlier — **make the fixture avoid zeros** (`.max(1e-4)`) if the pin fails only on a zero-valued sample, and say so; zero-skipping is the spec's rule for missing coverage, not a defect.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the pin and the whole combine module** — `cargo test -p athenaeum-core combine::` → all pass, including every pre-existing `legacy_equivalence_*` and rejection test unchanged.

If the percentile-clip all-rejected fixture does not actually reject everything under the existing routine's semantics, replace it with `Rejection::SigmaClip { sigma_low: 0.0, sigma_high: 0.0 }` on `[0.2, 0.3, 0.4]` and report which; the assertion (bit equality with `combine_pixel`) is the point.

- [ ] **Step 8: Gates** — `cargo test -p athenaeum-core integration::` (every existing test unchanged), `cargo check -p athenaeum-core --no-default-features`, `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` zero new warnings, `rustfmt --edition 2021 crates/athenaeum-core/src/integration/combine.rs` (it is rustfmt-clean today — verify with `--check` before editing; if not, hand-edit only).

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit** — `feat(integration): generic rejection routines and the weighted, mask-reporting combiner`.

---

### Task 2: `combine.rs` — linear-fit dispersion parity

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/integration/combine.rs`

**Interfaces:** `reject_linear_fit` only; no signature change.

- [ ] **Step 1: Read the routine.** Today `d` is the mean absolute deviation of the residuals; the spec (§6.3) and the math reference (§3.4) want `s = 2·adev·sqrt(1 + b²)` where `b` is the fitted slope against rank and `adev` the mean absolute deviation from the line — so thresholds compare with sigma clipping.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing test:**

```rust
    #[test]
    fn linear_fit_dispersion_is_twice_adev_times_slope_factor() {
        // A perfect ramp of slope 0.01 per rank plus one spike. With the
        // old dispersion (adev alone) a 2.5-adev deviation is rejected at
        // thresholds 3.0; with s = 2·adev·sqrt(1 + b²) it survives.
        let mut ramp: Vec<f32> = (0..20).map(|j| 0.5 + 0.01 * j as f32).collect();
        // deviations: ±0.004 alternating, one at +0.009 (≈ 2.25 adev of 0.004)
        for (j, v) in ramp.iter_mut().enumerate() {
            *v += if j % 2 == 0 { 0.004 } else { -0.004 };
        }
        ramp[10] += 0.009;
        let mut a = ramp.clone();
        let (_, rejected) = combine_pixel(
            &mut a,
            IntegrationRecipe::average(Rejection::LinearFitClip { sigma_low: 3.0, sigma_high: 3.0 }),
        );
        assert_eq!(rejected, 0, "a 2.25-adev deviation survives at 3.0 with the doubled dispersion");
        let mut b = ramp.clone();
        b[10] += 0.05; // ≈ 12 adev — still rejected
        let (_, rejected) = combine_pixel(
            &mut b,
            IntegrationRecipe::average(Rejection::LinearFitClip { sigma_low: 3.0, sigma_high: 3.0 }),
        );
        assert_eq!(rejected, 1);
    }
```

Run it: the first assertion fails today (rejected == 1).

- [ ] **Step 3: Change the dispersion** in `reject_linear_fit`: where `d` (the mean absolute deviation of residuals) is computed, define `let s = 2.0 * adev * (1.0 + b * b).sqrt();` with `b` the fitted slope per rank unit, and use `s` in both threshold comparisons. Update the routine's doc comment: "dispersion `s = 2·adev·sqrt(1 + b²)` (math reference §3.4) so the thresholds compare with sigma clipping". Keep everything else (fit, iteration, guards) unchanged.

- [ ] **Step 4: Re-pin the affected tests.** Run `cargo test -p athenaeum-core combine::` — `linear_fit_keeps_clean_ramp`, `linear_fit_rejects_spike`, `linear_fit_terminates_on_constant_stack`, `linear_fit_all_rejected_uses_intact_stack_not_corruption` and the Task 1 pin (which uses linear fit at 5.0/3.5) must pass; if a spike fixture is no longer rejected at its threshold, double the spike or halve the threshold in **that test only** and record the measured old/new rejection in the test's comment ("dispersion doubled 2026-09-09; spike raised from x to y"). Do not touch any other test.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit** — `fix(integration): linear-fit clipping dispersion follows the reference (2·adev·sqrt(1+b²))`.

---

### Task 3: `engine.rs` — one band loop, the weighted stacking path; `RegisteredSource` scratch reuse

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/integration/engine.rs`
- Modify: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/integration/registered_source.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `combine_pixel_weighted`, mask helpers (Task 1); `FrameSource`, `BandPlanes`, `IoPolicy`, `EngineProgress`, `IntegrationOutput`; `NormalizationPair` (`integration::stats`).
- Produces:

```rust
/// Per-frame inputs of the stacking path, all indexed by the source's frame order.
pub struct StackParams<'a> {
    /// Rejection-normalization pair per frame (applied to the working copy).
    pub rejection: &'a [NormalizationPair],
    /// Output-normalization pair per frame (applied to the averaged values).
    pub output: &'a [NormalizationPair],
    /// Weight per frame (the plane's normalized weight; ≥ 0).
    pub weights: &'a [f32],
    /// Range rejection on RAW values: reject `raw <= range_low` (when Some) and `raw >= range_high` (when Some).
    pub range_low: Option<f32>,
    pub range_high: Option<f32>,
    /// Accumulate per-pixel low/high rejection counts.
    pub rejection_maps: bool,
}

pub struct StackOutput {
    pub base: IntegrationOutput,
    /// Per-pixel rejected-sample counts, low and high sides (`Some` when requested).
    pub rejection_low: Option<Vec<f32>>,
    pub rejection_high: Option<Vec<f32>>,
    /// Rejected samples per frame (range + algorithm), indexed by frame.
    pub rejected_per_frame: Vec<u64>,
    /// Samples the frame actually contributed (finite, in coverage), per frame.
    pub samples_per_frame: Vec<u64>,
    pub rejected_low: u64,
    pub rejected_high: u64,
}

pub fn integrate_stack<S: FrameSource + ?Sized>(
    src: &S,
    params: &StackParams<'_>,
    recipe: IntegrationRecipe,
    pool: &rayon::ThreadPool,
    cancel: &AtomicBool,
    progress: EngineProgress<'_>,
    io: IoPolicy,
) -> Result<StackOutput, IntegrationError>;
```

`integrate_registered` (Plan 1) stays as the unweighted convenience and now delegates to `integrate_stack` with identity pairs, unit weights, no range rejection and no maps — its Plan 1 test must still pass.

- [ ] **Step 1: Extract the band loop.** In `run_banded`, everything from `let mut planes = BandPlanes::new(src);` through the end of the `for (band_idx, y0)` loop is the skeleton; the per-band combine (`pool.install(|| out_band.par_chunks_mut(w)…)`) is the only part the two paths differ in. Introduce:

```rust
/// What a band-combine closure receives: the decoded band, the output rows
/// it must fill, the band's first global row, and the progress hook it must
/// tick once per output row (`rows_done_total, total_rows, bytes_read, bytes_total`).
struct BandJob<'a> {
    planes: &'a BandPlanes,
    out_band: &'a mut [f32],
    y0: usize,
    rows: usize,
    width: usize,
}

/// The read / progress / cancel / timing skeleton shared by every banded
/// integration. `combine(job, tick)` fills `job.out_band` (rows × width) and
/// calls `tick()` once per finished row.
#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]
fn band_loop<S: FrameSource + ?Sized>(
    src: &S,
    pool: &rayon::ThreadPool,
    cancel: &AtomicBool,
    progress: &EngineProgress<'_>,
    io: IoPolicy,
    out: &mut [f32],
    combine: &(dyn Fn(BandJob<'_>, &(dyn Fn() + Sync)) -> Result<(), IntegrationError> + Sync),
) -> Result<BandStats, IntegrationError>;

struct BandStats {
    read_duration: std::time::Duration,
    combine_duration: std::time::Duration,
    band_rows: usize,
    bands: usize,
    bytes_read: u64,
}
```

Move the loop body into `band_loop` verbatim — the `bytes_before_this_band`/`band_bytes_so_far` Mutex logic, the three cancel checks, `read_band_with_progress`, the timings, the `(progress.on_band)(…)` end-of-band call — and replace the `pool.install(…)` block by `pool.install(|| combine(BandJob { planes: &planes, out_band, y0, rows, width: w }, &tick))?` where `tick` is the closure that today does `let done = rows_combined.fetch_add(1, Relaxed) + 1; if done % COMBINE_TICK_ROWS == 0 || done == h { (progress.on_combine)(done, h, bytes_read, bytes_total); }` (`bytes_read` frozen for the band as today — capture the value, not the variable). Keep every comment that explains a fix-wave decision next to the code it explains.

`run_banded` becomes: allocate `out`, the `bad_samples`/`all_bad`/`rejected` counters, call `band_loop` with a closure that is **today's per-pixel body verbatim** (precal, `scales[i]`, finiteness, `combine_pixel`), then the non-finite output check and the `IntegrationOutput` assembly. **Every existing engine test passes unchanged — that is the pin for this step**; run `cargo test -p athenaeum-core engine::` before going on.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing stacking-path test** (in `engine.rs`'s `tests`, next to the existing fixtures; it uses the module's `write`/`pool`/`io`/`nop` helpers — read them first):

```rust
    #[test]

(`write` in the engine tests takes a closure `Fn(usize, usize) -> f32`; if its signature differs, adapt the calls, not the intent. If `nop()` returns a closure by value, take a reference as the existing tests do.)

- [ ] **Step 3: Run to see them fail** (no `StackParams`/`integrate_stack`).

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the stacking path.** Add the types from the Interfaces block, then:

```rust
/// Weighted, normalized banded integration with survivor accounting (spec
/// §6.1–6.2). Per sample: finiteness (missing coverage is skipped, not
/// rejected), range rejection on the raw value, then the rejection copy
/// `raw·rs + ro` decides survival and the output copy `raw·os + oo` is what
/// the survivors' weighted mean (or median) is taken over.

**The zip of map rows above is deliberately NOT the final shape** — it is unreadable. Implement the map accumulation the simple way instead: give each row worker its own two `Vec<f32>` row buffers (`low_row`, `high_row`, length `width`, zeroed per row), write `low_here`/`high_here` into them per pixel, and after the row is done copy them into the band's map slices through a per-band `Mutex<Vec<(usize, Vec<f32>, Vec<f32>)>>` **or** — simpler still and what this plan requires — split the maps into per-row mutable chunks **before** the parallel loop with `par_chunks_mut(width)` on `map_low`/`map_high` slices of the band, zipped with `out_band.par_chunks_mut(width)` via `rayon`'s `zip` (all three iterators have exactly `rows` items when `maps` is true; when `maps` is false use two empty dummy vectors of length `rows * width` allocated once per run — 2 × w × h × 4 bytes is the same size as the maps themselves, so allocate them only once, outside the closure, and reuse across bands). With that, the per-pixel code is: `low_row[x] = low_here as f32; high_row[x] = high_here as f32;` when `maps`. Delete the `present`/`map_rows` scaffolding from the sketch. The per-worker `work`/`out_vals`/`mask` buffers stay as written (allocated once per row, not per pixel).

After `band_loop` returns: the same non-finite output check as `run_banded`, then

```rust
    let total_samples = (w * h * n).max(1);
    Ok(StackOutput {
        base: IntegrationOutput {
            width: w,
            height: h,
            data: out,
            rejected_fraction: rejected.load(Ordering::Relaxed) as f64 / total_samples as f64,
            flat_norm: None,
            bad_samples_per_frame: bad_samples.into_iter().map(|a| a.into_inner()).collect(),
            all_bad_pixels: all_bad.into_inner(),
            read_duration: stats.read_duration,
            combine_duration: stats.combine_duration,
            band_rows: stats.band_rows,
            bands: stats.bands,
            bytes_read: stats.bytes_read,
        },
        rejection_low: maps.then_some(map_low),
        rejection_high: maps.then_some(map_high),
        rejected_per_frame: rejected_per_frame.into_iter().map(|a| a.into_inner()).collect(),
        samples_per_frame: samples_per_frame.into_iter().map(|a| a.into_inner()).collect(),
        rejected_low: rejected_low.into_inner(),
        rejected_high: rejected_high.into_inner(),
    })
```

`rejected_fraction` counts algorithm rejections only (as the master path); the checkpoint compares `(rejected_low + rejected_high) / Σ samples_per_frame`, which includes range rejections, with the external "Total" line — document both on the struct.

`integrate_registered` becomes a thin wrapper: identity pairs, unit weights, `range_low: None`, `range_high: None`, `rejection_maps: false`, returning `.base` (its signature and the Plan 1 test are unchanged).

- [ ] **Step 5: `RegisteredSource` scratch reuse.** In `read_band_with_progress`, each worker (the `workers == 1` loop and each scoped worker thread) owns `let mut raw_scratch: Vec<u8> = Vec::new(); let mut src_buf: Vec<f32> = Vec::new();` and passes them to `fill_frame(i, y0, rows, dst, &mut raw_scratch, &mut src_buf)`, which calls `reader.read_rows_with_scratch(self.plane, sy0, src_rows, &mut src_buf[..src_rows * sw], &mut raw_scratch)` after `src_buf.resize(src_rows * sw, 0.0)` (grow only). The `Whole` window fallback reuses the same buffers. Existing `registered_source` tests pass unchanged; add one assertion-free smoke: nothing — the existing `integrating_shifted_frames_yields_an_aligned_average_with_exact_coverage_accounting` test exercises multi-band multi-frame fills through the reused buffers.

- [ ] **Step 6: Gates** — `cargo test -p athenaeum-core integration::` (all, including Plan 1's registered-source tests), headless check, workspace check (zero new warnings), rustfmt on `engine.rs` and `registered_source.rs` if they were clean before (`--check` first).

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit** — `feat(integration): one band loop; weighted, normalized stacking path with rejection maps and per-frame accounting`.

### Task 4: `stacking/integrate.rs` — configuration, the Auto rule, per-frame normalization and weights, the group driver

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/stacking/integrate.rs`
- Modify (hand edit): `crates/athenaeum-core/src/stacking/mod.rs` — add `pub mod integrate;` and one sentence to the module doc.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `integration::{combine::{IntegrationRecipe, Rejection, Combination}, engine::{integrate_stack, StackParams, StackOutput, EngineProgress}, registered_source::{RegisteredSource, RegisteredFrame}, stats::{LocationScale, OutputNormalization, RejectionNormalization, ScaleEstimator, NormalizationPair, output_pair, rejection_pair}, io_policy::IoPolicy, IntegrationError}`, `stacking::measure::{FrameMeasurement, measure_plane, MeasureOptions, ADU_SCALE}`, `stacking::weights::FrameWeight`, `stacking::psf_signal::noise_mrs`, `geometry::PixelMap`, `resample::Interpolation`.
- Produces (all `pub`):

```

Write the three sketched tests in full (they are the plan's acceptance for this task; the sketch tells you what to assert, the numbers come from your fixture — record any bound you had to pick in the test's comment).

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement.** Key points of `integrate_group`:
  1. Validate: `frames.len() ≥ 3`; `reference < frames.len()`; every `measurement.channels.len() == channels`; `normalization.rejection != Local` (else `BadInput("local normalization is M2; use scaleZeroOffset or equalizeFluxes")`).
  2. **Min-weight drop**: a frame whose `weight.normalized.iter().cloned().fold(f64::INFINITY, f64::min) < integration.min_weight` is dropped (`warn!(path, weight, min_weight, "frame dropped below the minimum weight")`); the reference is never dropped (warn if it would have been); `included` = the surviving indices in input order; `< 3` → `BadInput("fewer than 3 frames after the weight floor")`.
  3. Recipe: `IntegrationRecipe { combination, rejection: integration.rejection.resolve(included.len()) }`; `info!(frames = included.len(), recipe = %recipe.describe(), "group integration started")`.
  4. Per plane `p` in `0..channels`: `(progress.on_plane)(p, channels)`; pairs for each included frame `i`: `rejection_pair(ref_ls, frame_ls, normalization.rejection).unwrap()` and `output_pair(ref_ls, frame_ls, normalization.output)` where `ref_ls = frames[reference].measurement.channels[p].location_scale()`; weights `frame.weight.normalized[p] as f32` (missing channel → 0.0); `RegisteredSource::open(&registered_frames, width, height, p, interpolation, clamping)` with `RegisteredFrame { path, map }`; `integrate_stack` with `StackParams { rejection, output, weights, range_low: integration.range_low.map(|v| v as f32), range_high: …, rejection_maps: integration.write_rejection_maps }`; append `out.base.data` to `data`, maps to their vectors; accumulate `rejected_low/high`, `samples`, per-frame rejected, read/combine durations, bytes.
  5. Master measurement per plane: `measure_plane(&plane_data, width, height, measure, Some(pool))` → `noise` (already native? `ChannelMeasurement.noise` — read Plan 2's `measure_plane` to see whether `noise` is reported in native units or ADU; convert to native `[0, 1]` units for `master_noise` and state it in the doc comment), `location`, `scale`, `psf_snr`, `fwhm_px`, `eccentricity`; best sub = the included frame with the highest `weight.normalized_mean`: its `measurement.channels[p].noise`/`psf_snr`; `snr_gain = master_psf_snr / best_sub_psf_snr` (`NaN` → 0.0 with a warn).
  6. Exposure: `total_exposure_s = Σ exposure`; `weighted_exposure_s = Σ exposure_i · w̄_i` with `w̄_i` = mean of `weight.normalized` over planes.
  7. Cancel: check `cancel` before each plane (the engine checks inside); `debug!(plane, rejected_low, rejected_high, duration_ms, "plane integrated")`; `info!(frames, planes, rejected_fraction, duration_ms, "group integration finished")`.
  8. Logging dictionary: reuse `frames` (usize), `planes` (usize — new: "planes the group integrated"), `plane` (usize — index), `rejected_low` / `rejected_high` (u64 — rejected samples per side), `rejected_fraction` (f64), `recipe`, `weight`, `min_weight` (f64 — the floor), `duration_ms`, `path`. Add the new names to the logging spec's dictionary in a "stacking integration" paragraph.

- [ ] **Step 3: Gates** — `cargo test -p athenaeum-core stacking::integrate`, `stacking::` whole, headless (the module is under the gated `stacking`), workspace check, rustfmt on the new file only.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit** — `feat(stacking): integration and normalization config, the Auto rejection rule, and the per-group weighted integration driver`.

### Task 5: `fits_writer/wcs.rs` — WCS cards from a stored plate solve

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/fits_writer/wcs.rs`
- Modify (hand edit): `crates/athenaeum-core/src/fits_writer/mod.rs` — `pub mod wcs;`

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement** — cards in this order: `WCSAXES` 2, `CTYPE1`/`CTYPE2` (`RA---TAN`/`DEC--TAN`, `-SIP` suffix when any SIP table is present), `CRPIX1`/`CRPIX2` (`crpix + 1.0`, comment "1-based reference pixel"), `CRVAL1`/`CRVAL2` (comment "deg"), `CD1_1`…`CD2_2`, `CUNIT1`/`CUNIT2` `deg`, `RADESYS` `ICRS`, `EQUINOX` 2000.0, then `A_ORDER`/`B_ORDER` + non-zero `A_i_j`/`B_i_j` (`i + j ≤ order`, `i + j ≥ 2` — the linear terms belong to the CD matrix; if the table carries non-zero `i + j < 2` entries, return `FitsWriteError::InvalidValue`-style error naming the term — pick the existing error variant that fits a bad value), then `AP_ORDER`/`BP_ORDER` + `AP_i_j`/`BP_i_j` when both reverse tables are present. Parse the JSON with `serde_json::from_str::<Vec<Vec<f64>>>`; an error maps to the writer's error type (`FitsWriteError` has variants for invalid keyword/value — map to the value one with the message). Add a `PLTSOLVD` logical `true` card with comment "plate solved by Athenaeum".

- [ ] **Step 3: Gates** — `cargo test -p athenaeum-core fits_writer::wcs`, headless check (ungated module), rustfmt on the new file.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit** — `feat(fits_writer): WCS and SIP cards from a stored plate solve`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement.** `build_master_light_cards`: start with `HeaderBuilder::new(FrameKind::MasterLight).swcreate(app_version).build()?`, then append the reference's cards filtered by `REGISTERED_COPY_THROUGH` **minus** `EXPTIME` and `DATE-OBS` (replaced below), then `NCOMBINE` (Integer), `EXPTIME` (weighted total, comment "weighted total exposure, s"), `DATE-OBS`/`DATE-END` when given, then `wcs_cards(solve)?` when `Some`, then the `ATH_STK*` provenance cards with comments (`ATH_STK` "stacked by Athenaeum; never cataloged", `ATH_STKV` "stacking header version", `ATH_STKN` "frames combined", `ATH_STKR` "combination | rejection", `ATH_STKW` "weight mode", `ATH_STKO` "output/rejection normalization", `ATH_STKF` "reference frame", `ATH_STKG` "group key", `ATH_STKI` "stacking run"). `master_file_name`: `sanitize_for_filename` on each part; `filter.unwrap_or("NoFilter")`, `instrume.unwrap_or("unknown")`; equal exposures = every `|e − e0| ≤ 0.5`; number formatting: `if x == x.trunc() { format!("{x:.0}") } else { format!("{x:.1}") }`. `write_master_light`: `resolve_collision(&dir.join(file_name))` for the master; maps: `<stem>_rejlow.fits`/`_rejhigh.fits` also through `resolve_collision`; map cards: `IMAGETYP` `Rejection Map Low`/`High` (plain `Card`, not `FrameKind`), `ATH_STK` true, `ATH_STKV`, `BUNIT` `count`, and the master's `ATH_STKI`/`ATH_STKG` cards copied; `write_fits_f32(path, w, h, channels, data, cards)`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Spec corrections** in §6.4 (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-08-stacking-pipeline-design.md`): `IMAGETYP = 'MASTER LIGHT'` → `IMAGETYP = 'Master Light'` (the writer's `FrameKind::MasterLight`, one spelling for every master the app writes); `ATH_STKID` → `ATH_STKI` with the parenthetical "(run id; FITS keywords are eight characters)".

- [ ] **Step 4: Gates** — `cargo test -p athenaeum-core stacking::master_cards`, headless, workspace, rustfmt on the new file.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit** — `feat(stacking): master-light header, file naming and writers`.

### Task 7: `examples/integrate_probe.rs`, `MRS_LAYER1_GAIN` rename, docs

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/athenaeum-core/examples/integrate_probe.rs`
- Modify: `crates/athenaeum-core/Cargo.toml` — `[[example]] name = "integrate_probe"`, `required-features = ["render", "solver"]` (after `register_probe`)
- Modify: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/stacking/psf_signal.rs` — rename `MRS_LAYER0_GAIN` → `MRS_LAYER1_GAIN` (doc: "the estimator reports layer-1 coefficients"), `background_residual` gains `assert!(data.len() == w * h)`… no — a `debug_assert!` is not enough for a public fn: return `None` with a `warn!` when `data.len() != w * h`.
- Modify: `CLAUDE.md` module map sentence (append `integrate`/`master_cards` and `fits_writer::wcs`, `examples/integrate_probe.rs`); logging spec dictionary (Task 4's names, if not already added there).

**The probe** (`cargo run --release -p athenaeum-core --example integrate_probe -- <reference.fits> <dir-with-c_*.fits> --out <dir> [--limit N] [--osc] [--distortion off|auto] [--rejection auto|linearFit|winsorized] [--maps] [--compare <external master .xisf>] [--json <path>]`):

1. Reference detection (`reference_stars`), then for every `c_*.fits` (mono) or `c_*_d.fits` (`--osc`) in the folder (sorted, `--limit`): `register_frame` (Plan 3) — skip failures with a warning; `measure_frame` (Plan 2, `MeasureOptions::default()`); collect `StackFrame` (exposure from the header `EXPTIME` via `FitsHeader`, `DATE-OBS` text).
2. `compute_weights(WeightMode::PsfSignalWeight)`; `integrate_group` with `IntegrationConfig { rejection: per flag, write_rejection_maps: --maps, ..default }`, `NormalizationConfig::default()`; progress printed per plane/band to stderr every ~2 s.
3. Write the master through `master_file_name` + `build_master_light_cards` (reference cards from the reference file; `wcs: None` in the probe — the probe has no catalog) + `write_master_light`.
4. JSON to stdout (or `--json`): frames, registered, failed, included, recipe, per-plane stats (`master_noise`, `location`, `scale`, `psf_snr`, `snr_gain`, `fwhm`, `eccentricity`), `rejected_low/high_fraction`, timings (register ms, measure ms, integrate read/combine ms, write ms, total), bytes read.
5. `--seeds fast|full` (default `fast`): which detector seeds the measurement fits — `fast` = `detect_fast_data` as `measure_plane` does today; `full` = `ImageAnalyzer::analyze_data` on the same ADU-scaled plane (`with_max_stars(opts.max_stars)`, `with_mrs_layers` as the analyzer's default) whose `stars` become the seeds (x, y, flux, and the analyzer's FWHM as the size hint). Implement it as a `SeedSource` argument on a new `measure_plane_with_seeds(data, w, h, opts, pool, seeds: SeedSource)` in `stacking/measure.rs` — `measure_plane` keeps its signature and calls it with `SeedSource::Fast`; the `Full` arm maps `AnalysisResult.stars` into the existing `Seed` shape. `--seeds-report <n>`: for the first `n` frames also run the other detector and print, per frame, both star counts and the fraction of each seed set within 0.5 px of the other (Checkpoint B step 4b consumes this).
6. `--compare`: read the external master with `astroimage::ImageConverter::read_raw` (its first image; assert the header's first `<Image` has `id="integration"` by scanning the first 1 MB of the file for `id="` — report the id), normalize by 65535 when the finite max exceeds 1.5 (Checkpoint A's finding on registered images; masters carry bounds 0:1 and are expected to be in range — report which); per plane: `noise_mrs` on both (native units), `location_scale` (median/BWMV) on both, the ratio ours/theirs, and a pixel-level comparison on the 1/16 stratified sample: median of `ours − theirs` and median of `|ours − theirs| / theirs` over pixels where `theirs > 2·noise`, plus star-level: `detect_stars` on both (top 300), match within 1.5 px, median flux ratio and median centroid delta. When `--maps` and the external file has `rejection_low`/`rejection_high` images, compare mean map values (ours ÷ n vs theirs).

Read `register_probe.rs` and `measure_probe.rs` first and reuse their argument parsing style, JSON shape and the `read_luminance_any` helper (copy it; examples do not share code).

- [ ] Step 1: write the example; Step 2: build in release; Step 3: smoke on `--limit 12` mono frames (≈ 10 s), report the JSON; Step 4: gates (`cargo build --release --example integrate_probe`, headless, workspace zero warnings, rustfmt on the example and `psf_signal.rs` if clean); Step 5: commit `chore(stacking): integrate_probe example, MRS gain rename, docs`.

### Task 8 (controller-run): Checkpoint B on LDN 1272

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/superpowers/research/2026-09-09-checkpoint-b-integration.md`

**Inputs:** `ATH="…/LDN1272-WBPP/LDN1272-ATH/LDN 1272"`, `OUT="…/LDN1272-Output"`; reference `$ATH/camera_atr2600m/lights/c_2025-10-18_02-02-02__-9.90_180.00s_0073.fits`; external masters `$OUT/master/masterLight_BIN-1_6224x4168_EXPOSURE-180.00s_FILTER-NoFilter_mono_(1).xisf` (208 frames, PSF Signal Weight, linear fit 5.0/3.5, additive-with-scaling output normalization, **local** rejection normalization, range-low on; log: rejected 2.831 % = 0.841 % low + 1.989 % high; master noise 1.9570e-05, location 7.183186e-03, scale 2.062522e-04, PSF SNR 1.2458e+04, PSFSW 534.07, 58 350 PSF fits) and `…_RGB_(1).xisf` (160 frames, per channel rejected 2.508/2.790/2.639 %, noise 1.6716e-05/1.6631e-05/1.4975e-05, location 1.119e-03/2.706e-03/2.161e-03, PSF SNR 2318.6/4136.4/3232.1).

- [ ] **Step 1:** `cargo build --release -p athenaeum-core --example integrate_probe`.
- [ ] **Step 2: Mono group** — `integrate_probe "$REF" "$ATH/camera_atr2600m/lights" --out <scratch>/cpB/mono --rejection auto --maps --compare "<mono master (1)>" --json <scratch>/cpB/mono.json` (208 frames: expect ≈ 1 min registration + ≈ 3 min measurement + the integration pass at disk speed — note the wall time and bytes read).
- [ ] **Step 3: OSC group** — same with `--osc` on `camera_zwoasi2600mcduo/lights` and the RGB master, `--distortion off` and once with `--distortion auto` if time allows.
- [ ] **Step 4: Targets (spec §13):** master MRS noise within ±5 % of the external master per plane; rejected fraction 1–4 % (report ours vs 2.831 % / 2.5–2.8 % with the LN caveat, ruling 13); frames registered 208/208 and 160/160; artifacts: view the mono master at 400 % around the brightest trail the external maps show (`rejection_high` image of the external file has the trails — locate the top three connected high-rejection blobs from its map and check ours at those coordinates); wall time ≤ 8 min per group integrate stage; `snr_gain` reported. A target missed by a wide margin is a defect to fix in this plan (a fix round on the responsible task) before Plan 5; a near miss is recorded with its cause and a ruling.
- [ ] **Step 4b: Detector comparison (owner's rule, 2026-09-09).** The measurement stage seeds its PSF fits with the fast adaptive detector (`ImageAnalyzer::detect_fast_data`, the plate solver's falling-threshold ladder); the analysis page uses the two-pass calibrated-kernel detector (`analyze_data`: mesh background + MRS noise → pass 1 with a 3 px kernel → free-β Moffat PSF calibration → pass 2 with the refined kernel). On three mono subjects spanning the weight range (the best, the median and the worst PSFSW of the group) run both: the fast seeds as Plan 2 uses them (`max_stars 24576`) and `analyze_data` with the same cap; report star counts, the fraction of fast seeds within 0.5 px of a two-pass detection and vice versa, and PSFSW/PSF SNR recomputed by `measure_plane` from each seed set (the probe gains a `--seeds fast|full` switch for this). Then the rank correlation of our per-frame PSFSW against the external log's per-frame weights (`WBPPWGHT` values in the log's `II.images` block for the mono integration) with each seed set. **Ruling for Plan 5:** registration keeps the fast detector (Checkpoint A proved it); the measurement seeds switch to the two-pass detector only if its rank correlation is higher by more than 0.02 and the per-frame cost stays within the spec's 5-minute measurement budget for 368 frames — record the numbers and the decision in the note.

- [ ] **Step 5: Write the note** (tables: external baselines; our per-plane stats; ratios; pixel/star-level comparison; the detector comparison; timing; verdict per target; findings and rulings; carry-forwards for Plan 5 and M2) and commit: `docs(stacking): checkpoint B — weighted integration against the external masters`.

## Self-review (done while writing)

**Spec coverage.** §6.1 engine generalization: weights, offsets (pairs), channel loop, survivor masks (Tasks 3–4); the optional LN grid is M2 (refused with a named error). §6.2 combiner v2 with masks, rejection maps and per-frame rejected fraction (Tasks 1, 3, 4); per-frame rejection bitmaps are drizzle-only (M3). §6.3 rejection menu, linear-fit parity now, Winsorized parity M4, the Auto rule, range rejection, `minWeight` (Tasks 2, 4). §6.4 master output, copy-through, WCS writer, provenance cards, rejection-map files, naming (Tasks 5, 6); the scanner rule already exists (Plan 3); stats per group (Task 4). §5.1 global normalization from stage-3 statistics (Task 4). §13 unit items: weighted rejection with masks byte-identical (Task 1 pin + Task 3 pin), rejection maps (Task 3), WCS round trip (Task 5); real-data items: Checkpoint B (Task 8). §14 items 7 and 8 covered; item 9+ is Plan 5.

**Placeholder scan.** Task 3's sketch contains an explicitly rejected zip construction with the required replacement spelled out; Task 4's three sketched tests name their assertions and require the implementer to write them in full; no "TBD".

**Type consistency.** `StackParams`/`StackOutput`/`integrate_stack` (Task 3) are what Task 4 consumes; `GroupOutput`/`GroupStats` (Task 4) are what Task 6's writer and Task 7's probe consume; `wcs_cards` (Task 5) is what Task 6 calls; `RejectionChoice::resolve` returns the existing `Rejection`; `FrameKind::MasterLight` exists; `PlateSolveRecord` fields are as listed; `NormalizationPair`, `output_pair`, `rejection_pair`, `LocationScale`, `ChannelMeasurement::location_scale`, `FrameWeight.normalized`, `measure_plane`, `noise_mrs`, `RegisteredSource::open`, `write_fits_f32`, `resolve_collision`, `sanitize_for_filename`, `source_cards_from_file`, `REGISTERED_COPY_THROUGH` all exist with the signatures used above (verified 2026-09-09).
