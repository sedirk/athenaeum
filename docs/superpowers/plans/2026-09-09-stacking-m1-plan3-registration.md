# Stacking M1 — Plan 3: Registration v2 Service — Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Register one calibrated light frame onto a reference frame the way
the stacking pipeline needs it — detection on the calibrated planes, a
quad-seeded correspondence search, RANSAC on the configured linear model, a
σ-weighted refit, optional polynomial distortion, per-frame QA and failure
rules, the `registration_results` row that records it, an optional
registered-frame writer, and the dev probe that lets Checkpoint A compare all
of it with the WBPP run on the owner's LDN 1272 data.

**Architecture:** A new `stacking::register` module (gated `render + solver`
with the rest of `stacking`) with four leaves: `mod.rs` (the configuration
with the spec §9.2 names and defaults), `detect.rs` (registration stars on a
luminance plane), `align.rs` (seed → KD-tree → RANSAC → refit → distortion →
QA, pure geometry over star lists), `frame.rs` (the per-frame driver over
`PlaneReader` plus the `RegistrationRecord` conversion), `writer.rs` (the
`r_<stem>.fits` writer with `ATH_REG*` cards). The existing
`registration_results` table gains the nine spec §9.1 columns through the
guarded-`ALTER` pattern; the scanner learns to skip `ATH_REG`/`ATH_STK`
artifacts. Set-level orchestration (grouping, reference choice, fan-out,
events, persistence of a whole set, retiring the old commands) stays in
Plan 5; the old plate-solve-based `registration::service` is untouched.

**Tech Stack:** Rust 2021, `athenaeum-core`; Plan 1's `geometry` (`Linear`,
`PixelMap`, `Distortion`, `KdTree2`, `ransac_fit`, `refit_weighted`) and
`resample` (`warp_rows`, `Interpolation`); the `solvemyastro` submodule's
public quad matcher (`solvemyastro::quad::{group_size_for, build_quads,
match_quads, fit_affine}`) as the seed; `astroimage::ImageAnalyzer` for
detection; `rusqlite`, `serde`/`serde_json`, `ts_rs`; `tempfile` in tests.
No new crate dependencies.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-08-stacking-pipeline-design.md`
§3 (registration: detection, matching, models, geometry, interpolation, QA,
registered frames), §9.1 (`registration_results` columns and
`transform_json`), §9.2 (`registration` config names), §9.5 (`registered/`
layout), §13 (Checkpoint A targets); math in
`docs/superpowers/research/2026-09-08-stacking-math-reference.md` §5.2–5.4.

## M1 program index (this is Plan 3 of 5)

| Plan | Scope | Status |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | kernels, warp, window, `Linear`/`PixelMap`/`Polynomial2D`, KD-tree, RANSAC, `PlaneReader`, `FrameSource`, `RegisteredSource` | merged 2afa55ad |
| 2 | `integration/stats.rs`, `stacking/{robust,psf_signal,measure,weights}.rs`, `measure_probe` | merged (see `git log`) |
| **3 (this)** | `stacking/register/{mod,detect,align,frame,writer}.rs`, `registration_results` v2 columns, scanner skip, `register_probe`, **Checkpoint A** | — |
| 4 | Combiner v2 + engine (weights, offsets, masks, rejection maps, channel loop) + WCS writer + master cards → Checkpoint B | consumes `PixelMap` rows from here |
| 5 | Orchestration, tables, commands ×2, `ts_export`, events, the Stacking tab, acceptance run | consumes `RegistrationConfig`, `reference_stars`, `register_frame`, `to_record`, `write_registered_frame` |

**Checkpoint A (this plan's last task, run by the controller on the owner's
data):** register the app's own calibrated LDN 1272 frames
(`~/Pictures/Calibration Test/LDN1272-WBPP/LDN1272-ATH/LDN 1272/camera_*/lights/c_*.fits`,
208 mono + 160 OSC) onto the WBPP reference
`c_2025-10-18_02-02-02__-9.90_180.00s_0073.fits` and compare with the
`.xdrz` sidecars in `~/Pictures/Calibration Test/LDN1272-Output/registered/`
(a 3×3 `AlignmentMatrix`, `AlignmentOrigin 0.5`, no splines) and the log's
per-frame `delta_RMS`. Results go to
`docs/superpowers/research/2026-09-09-checkpoint-a-registration.md`.

## Rulings made while writing this plan

1. **Where the code lives.** New code goes under `stacking::register` (the
   program's module), not into the old `registration` module; only the
   `registration_results` table and `RegistrationRecord` are extended,
   because Plan 5 keeps that table. The plate-solve-based
   `registration::service` and its three commands stay until Plan 5 retires
   them.
2. **Seed.** The subject→reference seed is `solvemyastro::quad`'s matcher
   exactly as the old service calls it (subject plays "image", reference
   plays "catalog", tolerance 0.007, `fit_affine` returns image→catalog),
   wrapped into a `Linear` of kind `Affine`. One pass of KD-tree
   correspondences at `2 × ransacTolerancePx` follows; re-collecting pairs
   through the refined model (the reference's local-correction loop) is an
   M4 refinement.
3. **`model: auto`.** The RANSAC kind is chosen from the correspondence
   count (≥ 30 homography, ≥ 12 affine, else similarity); the refit kind is
   chosen again from the inlier count, so it can only step down. The
   recorded model is the refit kind.
4. **`distortion: auto`.** Polynomial order 3 when the subject's geometry
   differs from the reference's and the refit keeps ≥ 200 inliers; a
   polynomial of order `o` needs ≥ `(o+1)(o+2)` inliers or it is skipped with
   a warning (never a failure). Distortion is centred on the reference
   frame's centre with `scale = max(W, H)/2`.
5. **QA numbers** are computed through the final map (linear or with
   distortion) on the refit's inliers: RMS, σ of the residual distances,
   per-axis peak. Scale, rotation, translation and the flip come from the
   linear part.
6. **σ weights.** `refit_weighted` and `Distortion::fit` get per-pair
   `(σx, σy)` = the quadrature sum of the subject's and the reference's
   fitted centroid σ (`FastStar::sx/sy`, present when the detector's Moffat
   refinement succeeded) and uniform weights when any pair lacks them.
7. **Legacy columns.** `affine_a1..c2` receive the top two rows of the
   linear part even for a homography (the projective row lives in
   `transform_json`); the WCS columns stay NULL — v2 does not plate-solve,
   the master's WCS is Plan 4's job from the reference's own solve.
8. **Registered-frame cards.** Copy-through = optics/acquisition, DATE-OBS,
   session/target only — never WCS (the pixel grid is the reference's now)
   and never Bayer/CFA (the frame is resampled). `IMAGETYP = 'LIGHT'`,
   `ATH_REG = T`, `ATH_REGV = 1`, `ATH_REGR` (reference stem), `ATH_REGM`
   (model string), `ATH_REGK` (kernel), `ATH_REGC` (clamping), `ATH_REGS`
   (RMS), `ATH_REGT` (the `transform_json`, CONTINUE chain, no comment).
9. **Scanner skip** for `ATH_REG` and `ATH_STK` lands here (the first plan
   that writes such artifacts), extending the calibrated-artifact rule at
   both scan sites, not in Plan 4.
10. **Model string** recorded in `registration_results.model`: the linear
    kind's serde name, plus `+polynomial<o>` when distortion was fitted
    (`homography`, `homography+polynomial3`).
11. **Row order for Checkpoint A.** FITS (ours, bottom-up storage) and XISF
    (WBPP, top-down) differ by convention, and the `.xdrz` matrix lives in
    the WBPP image's coordinates with a 0.5 origin. The probe compares
    corner mappings under both row-order hypotheses and reports which one
    agrees, instead of guessing.
12. **`RegistrationRecord` gains `#[derive(Default)]`** so the three existing
    test literals and future callers can use `..Default::default()`; the
    generated `src/types/models.ts` is regenerated with
    `TS_RS_WRITE=1 cargo test -p athenaeum-core --test ts_contract` and
    committed — the only frontend file this plan touches, and only as a
    generated artifact.
13. **No `detection.sigma`.** Plan 2's final review found the fast
    detector never reads a detection sigma (its adaptive ladder targets
    `maxStars`; `minSnr` is the real sensitivity dial), and Plan 2 removed
    the knob from `MeasureOptions`. The same detector serves registration,
    so `DetectionConfig` carries only `minSnr` and `maxEccentricity`, and
    Task 6 amends spec §9.2 to drop `sigma: 5.0` from the `registration.
    detection` block. A config field that does nothing is the class of
    silent failure the project forbids.

## Rulings made during execution (2026-09-09; the code in git is the record, the task text below is historical)

- **Task 2 — detector fluxes depend on `maxStars`.** The adaptive
  detector's threshold, hence every star's aperture flux, follows the
  requested cap (≈ 1 % between two caps), so the truncation test compares
  the 10-star run to the full run by star identity (0.5 px), not by flux.
  Consequence for Plan 5: every frame of a group must be detected with the
  same `maxStars` (already true — it is group configuration).
- **Task 3 — joint distortion fit (supersedes ruling 4's single
  `Distortion::fit`).** Plan 1's polynomial carries degree ≥ 2 terms only,
  and the least-squares linear model absorbs a barrel term's linear
  projection, leaving a degree-1 residual the polynomial cannot represent
  (measured 0.146 px on a 1 px barrel); alternating the two fits converges
  at 0.883 per round (the linear↔cubic correlation on a finite field), so
  it was replaced by `Polynomial2D::fit_with_affine` + `Distortion::fit_joint`
  in `geometry/polynomial.rs` (one joint least squares, the affine part
  folded into the linear matrix `L′ = M·L`, both polynomial directions
  fitted around `L′`; the kind label is kept although a similarity may
  become a general affine) and `align::fit_distortion` calls it twice
  (`DISTORTION_ROUNDS = 2`). Result: polynomial-3 RMS 1.9e-5 px on the
  fixture. The linear-only assertion is `> 0.12` (0.164 measured — a
  homography absorbs part of a radial term), and the new `fit_joint` test
  bounds the inverse at 1e-2 px (0.0044 measured: the inverse polynomial
  has no linear terms and the inverse of a cubic is not a cubic).
- **Task 8 — Checkpoint A follow-ups.** The batch over ten real subjects
  (RMS 0.10–0.24 px, every frame below the external stacker's own
  residual) exposed that an order-3 polynomial fitted on the 15 %-overlap
  corner of one OSC subject extrapolated 178.8 px at the far corners, so
  (1) `Distortion` records the normalized box it was fitted over (inlier
  bounding box, 10 % margin per side) and clamps evaluation into it —
  `PixelMap` forward/inverse go through `forward_displacement` /
  `inverse_displacement`; a `transform_json` without `domain` stays valid
  and unbounded — and (2) `distortion: auto` additionally requires the
  RANSAC overlap index ≥ 0.6 (`AUTO_DISTORTION_MIN_OVERLAP`, a warning
  names the skip) and the regularity index ≥ 0.6
  (`AUTO_DISTORTION_MIN_REGULARITY`) — the overlap index is matching
  consistency, regularity is field coverage, and after Task 9's re-pairing
  only the latter separates a corner-fitted cubic. (3) Corner deltas
  against the sidecar measure extrapolation and the ±0.5 origin convention
  under 180° rotations, so the probe reports `starDeltaPx` (median/p95/max
  over reference stars both maps place inside the subject) as the
  Checkpoint A metric. (4) The probe's `--compare` normalizes an ADU-scale
  comparison image by 65535 and matches under the same row order only; any
  sidecar/write/compare error exits 1. (5) `ROWORDER` copies through to
  registered frames (orientation, not CFA). (6) The example no longer names
  the external stacker.
- **Task 9 — re-pairing through the refit model.** Correspondences were
  built once through the quad seed within 3.8 px; the seed's accuracy falls
  off with distance from the matched quads, so on the real data the
  identity-like subjects paired 1858–1933 of 2000 stars but the 8° / 0.8 %
  mono subject 870 and the cross-camera 11° subject 241 (overlap index
  0.35). `align` now re-pairs every subject star through the refit linear
  model and runs RANSAC + refit again on the larger set
  (`Alignment.repaired` counts the gain); a failed second pass keeps the
  first with a warning. `pair_through` / `ransac_and_refit` are the
  extracted steps 2 and 3–4.

## Carry-forwards from Plan 2's final review (for this plan's author and the next ones)

Recorded here because the Plan 2 ledger is deleted with its workspace.

- **This plan:** none beyond ruling 13; `stacking::measure::ADU_SCALE` is
  reused by `detect.rs`; the registration warns must carry the frame
  identity (they do — every `debug!`/`warn!` in `frame.rs` has `path`).
- **Plan 4 (combiner v2 + engine):** `read_rows_with_scratch` has no
  consumer yet — the banded engine is meant to use it (do not re-invent);
  `winsorize`'s "no survivors" guard keys on `lo.is_finite()` (a genuine
  ±∞ survivor mis-fires); `MRS_LAYER0_GAIN` is named "layer 0" where the
  estimator says layer 1 — rename before citing it; `background_residual`
  has no `data.len() == w·h` precondition.
- **Plan 5 (orchestration, tables, commands, UI):** `stars_detected` on
  `ChannelMeasurement` is the post-`minSnr` seed count — decide the name
  before it reaches `metrics_json` and the Frames table; `measure_plane`'s
  transient memory is ≈ 8× the plane (the ADU copy plus the mesh maps and
  the MRS layers) — a `ComputeQueue` sizing constraint, never measure
  planes concurrently; cancel is checked between planes only — cancel
  between frames and say so in the UI; `select_frames`'s `missing` is
  computed per channel (a zero-channel frame never gets "no exposure
  time"); `{:.2}` rounds a 0.125 threshold to "0.13" in the reason string;
  `measure_probe` maps an unknown model token to `Auto` silently; a
  coverage sweep before the acceptance run: PlaneReader never-shrunk
  scratch, `noise_scale_factors` two-pass loop, `BWMV_TO_SIGMA`, RCR NaN
  inputs and `n == 3`, `frame_shape`'s 1e-6 floor, the `Some(pool)` branch
  of `measure_plane`, `weights` empty/all-zero/all-excluded inputs. After a
  successful re-pairing pass (Task 9) `inlier_ratio` and the overlap index
  are ≈ 1 by construction — the second pairing is generated by the model it
  is then scored against — so frame selection must not read them as
  independent quality evidence; `rms_px`, `regularity` and the star-level
  sidecar metric are the discriminating numbers. `align` receives only the
  two geometries, so a cross-camera group with identical sensor geometry
  never triggers `distortion: auto` — the orchestrator must pass an
  `INSTRUME`-differs flag (spec §3.3) and the reference's `ROWORDER`
  (`RegisteredCards::reference_roworder`).
- **Checkpoint B watch items:** `moment_ellipse` seeds from the whole
  stamp (crowded fields may lose stars); `aperture` clips at the image
  border for fitted centres up to 2 px off the stamp centre.

## Global Constraints

- Logic lives in `crates/athenaeum-core`; the only files outside it this
  plan touches are the generated `src/types/models.ts` (Task 1) and the two
  docs (`CLAUDE.md`, the logging spec) in Task 6. Nothing in
  `athenaeum-tauri`/`athenaeum-web`, nothing in the submodules.
- `tracing` is the only logging API; `println!`/`eprintln!` are forbidden
  outside `#[cfg(test)]` and `examples/`. Messages are short stable phrases,
  data in snake_case fields; the fields this plan introduces are listed in
  Task 6 and added to the logging dictionary there.
- Never name the reference implementation (or any other product) in code or
  comments; cite the math reference document or the papers.
- The headless build must keep passing: `cargo check -p athenaeum-core
  --no-default-features` (`stacking` is gated off there; the schema change
  compiles everywhere).
- No new crate dependencies.
- Serde: every config enum/struct uses `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]`
  with the spec §9.2 names, pinned by tests, and every config struct carries
  `#[serde(default)]` so a partial JSON deserializes to defaults.
- Pixel convention: 0-based, integer coordinates are pixel centres;
  `PixelMap::forward` maps subject → reference, `Pair = (subject,
  reference)`.
- Existing behaviour is pinned: every test in `registration/`, `scanner/`,
  `tests/ts_contract.rs` and `tests/master_build.rs` passes after each task.
- Commit after every task, as the user (`git -c user.name=eg013ra1n -c
  user.email=vilen.sharifov@gmail.com commit …`), with the two trailers
  `Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>` and
  `Claude-Session: https://claude.ai/code/session_01DjyxL6wsv1HT5GiXxedbAY`.
- `rustfmt` only on files this plan creates (`stacking/register/*.rs`,
  `examples/register_probe.rs`). Never rustfmt `db/schema.rs`,
  `registration/db.rs`, `scanner/mod.rs`, `calibration_library/light_resolve.rs`,
  `lib.rs`, `stacking/mod.rs` or `Cargo.toml` — hand edits only. Clippy is
  not a gate.
- Test command shape: `cargo test -p athenaeum-core stacking::register`.

### Task 1: `registration_results` v2 columns and `RegistrationRecord`

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/db/schema.rs` (directly after the `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_registration_results_set …` statement that follows the `registration_results` CREATE TABLE)
- Modify: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/registration/db.rs` (`RegistrationRecord`, `upsert_registration`, `get_registration_for_frame_set`, the tests module)
- Regenerate: `src/types/models.ts`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `column_exists(conn, table, col) -> rusqlite::Result<bool>` (schema.rs, private helper already used for other migrations).
- Produces: `RegistrationRecord` with nine new fields `model: Option<String>`, `transform_json: Option<String>`, `inlier_ratio: Option<f64>`, `peak_error_px: Option<f64>`, `scale: Option<f64>`, `rotation_deg: Option<f64>`, `flipped: bool`, `config_hash: Option<String>`, `source_kind: Option<String>`, and `#[derive(Default)]`; `upsert_registration`/`get_registration_for_frame_set` round-trip them.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test** — append inside `mod tests` of `registration/db.rs` (follow the existing fixture pattern: `Connection::open_in_memory()` + `init_db(&conn)` + whatever rows the existing `upsert_and_get_round_trip` seeds for the FKs — reuse its helper verbatim):

```rust
    #[test]
    fn v2_columns_round_trip_and_default_for_old_rows() {
        let conn = rusqlite::Connection::open_in_memory().unwrap();
        init_db(&conn).unwrap();
        // Same seed rows as upsert_and_get_round_trip (frames_set + frames).
        seed_set_and_frames(&conn);
        let rec = RegistrationRecord {

            scale: Some(1.0002),
            rotation_deg: Some(-0.37),
            flipped: true,
            config_hash: Some("abc123".into()),
            source_kind: Some("calibrated".into()),
            ..Default::default()
        };
        upsert_registration(&conn, &rec).unwrap();
        // An old-style row: none of the v2 columns set.
        let legacy = RegistrationRecord {
            frames_set_id: 1,
            frame_id: 1,
            reference_frame_id: 1,
            is_reference: true,
            status: "reference".into(),
            registered_at: "2026-09-09T00:00:00Z".into(),
            ..Default::default()
        };
        upsert_registration(&conn, &legacy).unwrap();
        let rows = get_registration_for_frame_set(&conn, 1).unwrap();
        assert_eq!(rows.len(), 2);
        let (r1, r2) = (&rows[0], &rows[1]); // ordered by frame_id
        assert!(r1.is_reference && r1.model.is_none() && !r1.flipped);
        assert_eq!(r2.model.as_deref(), Some("homography+polynomial3"));
        assert_eq!(r2.transform_json.as_deref(), Some("{\"linear\":{}}"));
        assert_eq!(r2.inlier_ratio, Some(0.91));
        assert_eq!(r2.peak_error_px, Some(0.8));
        assert_eq!(r2.scale, Some(1.0002));
        assert_eq!(r2.rotation_deg, Some(-0.37));
        assert!(r2.flipped);
        assert_eq!(r2.config_hash.as_deref(), Some("abc123"));
        assert_eq!(r2.source_kind.as_deref(), Some("calibrated"));
    }

    #[test]
    fn migration_is_idempotent() {
        let conn = rusqlite::Connection::open_in_memory().unwrap();
        init_db(&conn).unwrap();
        init_db(&conn).unwrap();
        let n: i64 = conn
            .query_row(
                "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pragma_table_info('registration_results') WHERE name IN ('model','transform_json','inlier_ratio','peak_error_px','scale','rotation_deg','flipped','config_hash','source_kind')",
                [],
                |r| r.get(0),
            )
            .unwrap();
        assert_eq!(n, 9);
    }
```

If the existing tests have no shared seeding helper, extract one (`fn seed_set_and_frames(conn: &Connection)`) from `upsert_and_get_round_trip`'s setup lines and use it in all four tests — the extraction must not change what those tests insert.

    ] {
        if !column_exists(conn, "registration_results", col)? {
            conn.execute(
                &format!("ALTER TABLE registration_results ADD COLUMN {ddl}"),

        }
    }
```

`registration/db.rs` — on `RegistrationRecord`: add `Default` to the derive list; append the nine fields after `registered_at` with this doc:

```rust
    // ── Registration v2 (stacking spec §9.1) ──────────────────────────
    /// Resolved model: the linear kind's serde name, `+polynomial<o>` when a
    /// distortion was fitted. `None` on rows written by the old service.
    pub model: Option<String>,
    /// `PixelMap::to_json()` verbatim (spec §9.1).
    pub transform_json: Option<String>,
    pub inlier_ratio: Option<f64>,
    /// Larger of the two per-axis peak residuals, px.
    pub peak_error_px: Option<f64>,
    pub scale: Option<f64>,
    pub rotation_deg: Option<f64>,
    /// The linear part has a negative determinant (a meridian flip).
    pub flipped: bool,
    /// Hash of the registration config + reference identity that produced
    /// this row (spec §9.3).
    pub config_hash: Option<String>,
    /// `"calibrated"` for v2 rows; `None` for rows of the old service.
    pub source_kind: Option<String>,
```

`upsert_registration`: extend the column list with `model, transform_json, inlier_ratio, peak_error_px, scale, rotation_deg, flipped, config_hash, source_kind` and the VALUES with `?26 … ?34`, and the `params![]` with `rec.model, rec.transform_json, rec.inlier_ratio, rec.peak_error_px, rec.scale, rec.rotation_deg, rec.flipped as i64, rec.config_hash, rec.source_kind` in that order.

`get_registration_for_frame_set`: extend the SELECT list in the same order after `registered_at` and the row mapper with

```rust
                model: row.get(26)?,
                transform_json: row.get(27)?,
                inlier_ratio: row.get(28)?,
                peak_error_px: row.get(29)?,
                scale: row.get(30)?,
                rotation_deg: row.get(31)?,
                flipped: row.get::<_, i64>(32)? != 0,
                config_hash: row.get(33)?,
                source_kind: row.get(34)?,
```

Update the three existing test literals with `..Default::default()` where they now miss fields (no other change to them).

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests and regenerate TS**

Run: `cargo test -p athenaeum-core registration::db` → all pass (existing + 2 new).
Run: `TS_RS_WRITE=1 cargo test -p athenaeum-core --test ts_contract` (writes `src/types/models.ts`), then `cargo test -p athenaeum-core --test ts_contract` → passes; `git diff --stat src/types/models.ts` shows only the `RegistrationRecord` block changed.
Run: `cargo check -p athenaeum-core --no-default-features` → clean.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add crates/athenaeum-core/src/db/schema.rs crates/athenaeum-core/src/registration/db.rs src/types/models.ts
git -c user.name=eg013ra1n -c user.email=vilen.sharifov@gmail.com commit -m "feat(registration): v2 columns on registration_results and RegistrationRecord" -m "Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5.1 <noreply@anthropic.com>" -m "Claude-Session: https://claude.ai/code/session_01DjyxL6wsv1HT5GiXxedbAY"

### Task 2: `stacking/register/mod.rs` configuration and `detect.rs`

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/stacking/register/mod.rs`, `crates/athenaeum-core/src/stacking/register/detect.rs`
- Modify: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/stacking/mod.rs` (add `pub mod register;` — list stays alphabetical: `measure, psf_signal, register, robust, weights`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `crate::resample::Interpolation` (serde camelCase, no `Default`), `astroimage::ImageAnalyzer` (`new`, `with_max_stars`, `with_detection_sigma`, `with_centroid_refine`, `with_thread_pool`, `detect_fast_data(&[f32], w, h, 1) -> Result<FastAnalysisResult { stars: Vec<FastStar { x, y, peak, flux, snr, eccentricity, sx, sy, .. }>, background, .. }>`), `crate::stacking::measure::ADU_SCALE`, test fixtures `gaussian_field`, `moffat_field`, `MoffatStar`, `add_noise`.
- Produces: `RegistrationConfig` (+ `Default`, serde camelCase, container `default`), `ModelChoice`, `DistortionChoice` (+ `order()`), `DetectionConfig`; `detect::Star { x, y, flux: f64, sigma: Option<(f64, f64)> }`, `detect::SATURATION`, `detect::luminance(planes: &[&[f32]]) -> Vec<f32>`, `detect::detect_stars(lum: &[f32], w, h, cfg: &DetectionConfig, max_stars: usize, pool: Option<&Arc<rayon::ThreadPool>>) -> Vec<Star>`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify failure**

Add `pub mod register;` to `stacking/mod.rs`; create `register/mod.rs` with `pub mod detect;` and the tests; run `cargo test -p athenaeum-core stacking::register` → compile errors.

Run: `cargo test -p athenaeum-core stacking::register` → 5 pass. If the cut test fails, report the offending assertion with the detections found within 5 px of each planted star (x, y, peak + background, eccentricity, snr) — do not loosen the thresholds; the controller rules.
Run: `cargo check -p athenaeum-core --no-default-features` → clean.
Run: `rustfmt crates/athenaeum-core/src/stacking/register/mod.rs crates/athenaeum-core/src/stacking/register/detect.rs`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cargo test -p athenaeum-core stacking::register::align` → 5 pass. These fixtures were derived by hand (jitter 0.05 px gives RMS ≈ 0.07; 300 stars over 1000×800 give translation errors ≈ 0.005 px, rotation ≈ 1e-5 rad, scale ≈ 1e-5; the barrel term is 1.0 px at 500 px radius). If an assertion fails with a faithful transcription, report the measured values (model, pairs, inliers, rms, scale, rotation, translation, distortion order, warnings) and do not loosen — the controller rules. If the seed itself fails (`NoSeed`) on the 300-star scene, report the quad-match count.
Run: `rustfmt crates/athenaeum-core/src/stacking/register/align.rs`.

### Task 4: `frame.rs` — per-frame driver and the record conversion

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/stacking/register/frame.rs`
- Modify: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/stacking/register/mod.rs` (add `pub mod frame;`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `crate::integration::plane_reader::PlaneReader`, `crate::integration::IntegrationError`, `super::detect::{detect_stars, luminance, Star}`, `super::align::{align, model_name, AlignError, Alignment}`, `super::RegistrationConfig`, `crate::registration::db::RegistrationRecord`, `crate::geometry::{Linear, LinearKind, PixelMap}`.
- Produces: `struct ReferenceStars { stars: Vec<Star>, width, height: usize }`; `fn reference_stars(path: &Path, cfg: &RegistrationConfig, pool: Option<&Arc<rayon::ThreadPool>>) -> Result<ReferenceStars, IntegrationError>`; `struct FrameRegistration { width, height, detections: usize, outcome: Result<Alignment, AlignError>, duration_ms: u64 }`; `fn register_frame(reference: &ReferenceStars, subject: &Path, cfg, pool, cancel: &AtomicBool) -> Result<FrameRegistration, IntegrationError>`; `fn identity_registration(reference: &ReferenceStars) -> FrameRegistration`; `fn to_record(frames_set_id: i64, frame_id: i64, reference_frame_id: i64, is_reference: bool, reg: &FrameRegistration, config_hash: &str, registered_at: &str) -> RegistrationRecord`; `pub(crate) fn read_luminance(path: &Path) -> Result<(Vec<f32>, usize, usize), IntegrationError>`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cargo test -p athenaeum-core stacking::register` → all pass (frame: 4). If the forward-mapping or rotation assertion fails on a faithful transcription, report the measured `Alignment` (inliers, rms, scale, rotation, translation, model) and the number of reference/subject stars — the controller rules; the sign convention of `rotation_deg` (subject → reference is the inverse of the fixture's rotation) is the likeliest culprit and is reported, not "fixed" by flipping the test.
Run: `cargo check -p athenaeum-core --no-default-features` → clean.
Run: `rustfmt crates/athenaeum-core/src/stacking/register/frame.rs`.

### Task 5: `writer.rs` — registered frames with `ATH_REG*` cards, and the scanner skip

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/stacking/register/writer.rs`
- Modify: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/stacking/register/mod.rs` (add `pub mod writer;`)
- Modify: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/calibration_library/light_resolve.rs` (`fn card_from_kv` → `pub(crate) fn card_from_kv`)
- Modify: `crates/athenaeum-core/src/scanner/mod.rs` — both scan sites that carry the comment `Calibrated-LIGHT artifacts (spec 2026-08-31 §4) are recognized by their header cards and NEVER cataloged` (around lines 425–447 and again around 1596–1608): after the `if let Some(identity) = calibrated_light_identity(&keys) { … }` block, still inside `if let Some(ref header) = header_text { … }`, add the stacking-artifact skip; plus a test next to `scan_never_catalogs_a_calibrated_artifact`.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `crate::fits_parser::FitsHeader::{from_path, to_header_text}`, `crate::fits_parser::stored_header::parse_stored_header_keys(FileFormat, &str) -> HashMap<String, String>`, `crate::models::FileFormat::FITS`, `crate::calibration_library::light_resolve::card_from_kv(&str, &str) -> Option<Card>`, `crate::fits_writer::{write_fits_f32, Card, CardValue}`, `crate::resample::{warp_rows, Plane, Interpolation}`, `crate::geometry::PixelMap`, `PlaneReader`.
- Produces: `REGISTERED_COPY_THROUGH: &[&str]`, `ATH_REG_VERSION: i64 = 1`, `struct RegisteredCards<'a> { reference_name, model, transform_json: &'a str, interpolation: Interpolation, clamping: f32, rms_px: f64 }`, `fn source_cards_from_file(path: &Path) -> anyhow::Result<Vec<Card>>`, `fn build_registered_cards(source: &[Card], reg: &RegisteredCards) -> anyhow::Result<Vec<Card>>`, `fn write_registered_frame(subject: &Path, map: &PixelMap, ref_w: usize, ref_h: usize, interp: Interpolation, clamping: f32, cards: &[Card], out: &Path) -> anyhow::Result<usize>` (channels written). Scanner: files carrying `ATH_REG` or `ATH_STK` are never cataloged.

```

Scanner test (next to `scan_never_catalogs_a_calibrated_artifact`, same fixture style — a scan root in a temp dir, one file written by `write_fits_f32` with the cards below, a scan, then the assertion that no `files` row exists):

```rust
    #[test]
    fn scan_never_catalogs_a_stacking_artifact() {
        // Same setup as scan_never_catalogs_a_calibrated_artifact, but the
        // file carries ATH_REG = T (a registered frame) and no CALSTAT.
        // … fixture …
        let cards = vec![Card::new("ATH_REG", CardValue::Logical(true)).unwrap(), Card::new("IMAGETYP", CardValue::Str("LIGHT".into())).unwrap()];
        // write_fits_f32(&path, 16, 16, 1, &vec![0.1; 256], &cards)
        // scan the root
        // assert the files table has no row for `path`; repeat with ATH_STK = T
    }
```

(Write the fixture lines by copying the neighbouring test's; the assertion shape is the same.)

- [ ] **Step 2: Run to verify failure**

Add `pub mod writer;`; run `cargo test -p athenaeum-core stacking::register::writer` → compile errors; `cargo test -p athenaeum-core scan_never_catalogs_a_stacking_artifact` → fails (the file is cataloged).

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

`light_resolve.rs`: `fn card_from_kv(` → `pub(crate) fn card_from_kv(` (no other change).

`writer.rs`:

```rust
//! Optional registered frames (spec §3.7): the subject resampled once into

```

`warp_rows` takes `map: &dyn InverseMap` and `PixelMap` implements `InverseMap`, so `map` coerces as written. `FitsWriteError` and `IntegrationError` both implement `std::error::Error`, so `?`/`.with_context` convert them into `anyhow::Error`.

Scanner (both sites), right after the closing brace of `if let Some(identity) = calibrated_light_identity(&keys) { … }`:

```rust
        // Stacking artifacts (registered frames, masters — stacking spec §3.7,
        // §6.4) are recognized the same way and never cataloged.
        if keys.contains_key("ATH_REG") || keys.contains_key("ATH_STK") {
            tracing::debug!(
                root_id,
                path = %current_path,
                "stacking artifact (ATH_REG/ATH_STK) — never cataloged"
            );
            return Ok(None);
        }
```

(Use whatever the surrounding block binds for the root id and path — mirror the calibrated-artifact `debug!` two lines above it exactly. Check the key map's case: `calibrated_light_identity` looks up `ATH_CSRC` uppercase in the same map, so uppercase keys are the convention.)

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `cargo test -p athenaeum-core stacking::register::writer` → 2 pass; `cargo test -p athenaeum-core scanner::` → all pass incl. the new one; `cargo test -p athenaeum-core calibration_library::` and `export::` → unchanged.

### Task 6: `register_probe` example, docs

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/athenaeum-core/examples/register_probe.rs`
- Modify: `crates/athenaeum-core/Cargo.toml` — after the `measure_probe` `[[example]]` block add:

```toml
[[example]]
name = "register_probe"
required-features = ["render", "solver"]
```

- Modify: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-03-logging-overhaul-design.md` — insert directly BEFORE the paragraph beginning `**Dictionary note (fix round 2, 2026-09-06):**` (i.e. after the stacking-measurement paragraph Plan 2 added):

```markdown
**Dictionary extension (stacking registration, `stacking::register`, 2026-09-09):** `detections` (usize; registration stars found on a frame, on the `"reference stars detected"` and `"frame registered"` debugs and the `"frame registration failed"` warn), `model` (string; the resolved registration model, e.g. `homography+polynomial3`, on `"frame registered"`), `flipped` (bool; the linear part has a negative determinant — reuses the registration domain's existing name on `"frame registered"`). Reuses `path`, `inliers`, `rms_px` (the solve domain's names, same meaning: refit inliers and the RMS through the final map), `error` and `duration_ms`.
```

- Modify: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-08-stacking-pipeline-design.md` §9.2 — in the `registration:` block change `detection: { sigma: 5.0, minSnr: 10, maxEccentricity: 0.8 }` to `detection: { minSnr: 10, maxEccentricity: 0.8 }` (ruling 13); and in §3.1 replace the sentence beginning "`detect_fast` with Moffat centroid refinement" with: "`detect_fast` with Moffat centroid refinement (~0.05 px on well-sampled stars), per-star σ from the fit; the detector is threshold-free (its adaptive ladder targets `maxStars`), so there is no detection sigma."

Facts the example relies on (verified while writing this plan): `warp_rows` takes `map: &dyn InverseMap`, so `&a.map` coerces; `PixelMap`'s `linear`/`linear_inv` fields and `Linear::m` are public; `astroimage` re-exports `ImageConverter` and `PixelData` at its crate root (`rustafits/src/lib.rs`).

- [ ] **Step 2: Build and smoke it on synthetic data**

Run: `cargo build -p athenaeum-core --example register_probe` → builds.
Run: `cargo run -p athenaeum-core --example register_probe; echo "exit=$?"` → the usage line, `exit=2`.
Smoke: write two synthetic FITS with a throwaway test (or reuse the `frame.rs` fixture through `cargo test -- --nocapture` is not needed): run the probe on `crates/athenaeum-core/src/stacking/register/frame.rs`'s fixture by adding a temporary `#[test] #[ignore]` that writes `/tmp/…/reference.fits` + `subject.fits` — or simply run the probe on any two real calibrated FITS the machine has (the LDN 1272 export, see Task 7) and confirm a JSON with `"status": "aligned"` prints. Remove any temporary test before committing.

- [ ] **Step 3: Make the doc edits** exactly as specified above.

- [ ] **Step 4: Full gate**

Run: `cargo test -p athenaeum-core` → everything green (lib tests ≥ 1853 + the new ones; 12 ignored unchanged); `cargo test -p athenaeum-core --test ts_contract` → passes; `cargo check -p athenaeum-core --no-default-features` → clean; `cargo check --workspace --all-targets` → no new warnings from `athenaeum-core`; `rustfmt crates/athenaeum-core/examples/register_probe.rs`.

### Task 7 (controller-run): Checkpoint A on LDN 1272

**Files:**
- Create: `docs/superpowers/research/2026-09-09-checkpoint-a-registration.md`

**Inputs:** `ATH="/Volumes/BigMac/Users/astrobureau/Pictures/Calibration Test/LDN1272-WBPP/LDN1272-ATH/LDN 1272"`, `OUT="/Volumes/BigMac/Users/astrobureau/Pictures/Calibration Test/LDN1272-Output"`; reference `$ATH/camera_atr2600m/lights/c_2025-10-18_02-02-02__-9.90_180.00s_0073.fits`; sidecars under `$OUT/registered/Light_BIN-1_6224x4168_EXPOSURE-180.00s_FILTER-NoFilter_mono/<stem>_c_r.xdrz` and `…_6248x4176_…_RGB/<stem>_c_d_r.xdrz`; WBPP registered images `<stem>_c_r.xisf`; the log `$OUT/logs/20260908121336.log` (`* Loading target file: …<stem>_c.xisf` followed by `delta_RMS`).

- [ ] **Step 1: Build the probe in release mode** — `cargo build --release -p athenaeum-core --example register_probe`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Mono frames** — for 6 mono subjects spread over the night (the first, the last and four in between by filename order), run

```bash
target/release/examples/register_probe "$REF" "$ATH/camera_atr2600m/lights/c_<stem>.fits" --xdrz "$OUT/registered/…_mono/<stem>_c_r.xdrz" > /tmp/cpA-mono-<n>.json

and record per frame: our `inliers`, `rmsPx`, `scale`, `rotationDeg`, `translation`, `model`; the sidecar's scale/rotation; `cornerDeltaPx` under both row-order hypotheses (the smaller one is the comparison; note which); WBPP's `delta_RMS` for the same stem from the log.

- [ ] **Step 3: OSC frames** — the same for 4 OSC subjects (`camera_zwoasi2600mcduo/lights/`, sidecars in the `…_RGB` directory) with `--distortion auto` (cross-geometry → polynomial 3 when ≥ 200 inliers) and once more with `--distortion off`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Pixel-level check** — one mono subject: `--write /tmp/cpA-write --compare "$OUT/registered/…_mono/<stem>_c_r.xisf"`; record `matched`, `medianDxPx`, `medianDyPx`, `medianFluxRatioOursOverTheirs`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Timing** — wall time of one mono registration (`durationMs`) and of the reference detection; extrapolate to 368 frames single-threaded.

- [ ] **Step 6: Write the note** with the tables, the spec §13 targets (translation ≤ 0.05 px, rotation ≤ 0.001°, scale ≤ 1e-4 against the sidecar; our RMS ≤ WBPP's `delta_RMS` per frame), what passed, what did not, the row-order finding, and the carry-forwards for Plan 4/5. Commit:

A target missed by a wide margin is a defect to fix in this plan (a fix round on the responsible task) before Plan 4 starts; a near miss is recorded with its cause and a ruling.

## Self-review (done while writing)

**Spec coverage.** §3.1 detection on calibrated planes with the Moffat-refined
centroids, the three cuts, the 2000-brightest cap, luminance for RGB (Task 2).
§3.2 quad seed → KD-tree correspondences at 2·tol → RANSAC with the spec's
tolerance/iterations/min-inliers → σ-weighted refit with 3σ clipping →
optional distortion (Task 3). §3.3 the four linear/polynomial models and the
`auto` rules (Task 3; TPS is M4). §3.4 reference geometry + NaN coverage
(Task 5's writer through `warp_rows`; the lazy path is Plan 1's
`RegisteredSource`). §3.5 kernels/clamping are Plan 1's; the config exposes
them (Task 2). §3.6 QA fields and the three failure rules (Task 3),
recorded per frame (Task 4). §3.7 registered frames with `ATH_REG` cards
(Task 5). §9.1 the nine columns and `transform_json = PixelMap::to_json()`
(Tasks 1, 4). §9.2 names/defaults with `#[serde(default)]` (Task 2). §6.4's
scanner rule for `ATH_REG`/`ATH_STK` (Task 5). §13 Checkpoint A (Task 7).
Not here by design: set-level orchestration, events, the `registration`
span, retiring the old commands, `excludeOnRegistrationFailure` (Plan 5).

**Placeholder scan.** The scanner test body and the Task 6 smoke are the only
steps that lean on neighbouring code the implementer copies; both name the
exact neighbour. No TBD/TODO.

**Type consistency.** `Star { x, y, flux, sigma }` (Task 2) is what `align`
(Task 3), `frame` (Task 4) and the probe (Task 6) consume; `Alignment`'s
fields (Task 3) are what `to_record` (Task 4) and the probe read
(`quality_score`/`overlap`/`regularity` rather than a `Quality` value, so no
derive is assumed on Plan 1's struct); `RegistrationRecord`'s nine fields
(Task 1) are exactly the ones `to_record` sets; `RegisteredCards` (Task 5)
matches the probe's literal; `model_name` (Task 3) is used by Tasks 4–6;
`RegistrationConfig::default()` values match the serde test and the spec.
