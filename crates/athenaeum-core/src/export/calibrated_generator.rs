//! The calibrated-light generator: one place that turns a catalogued LIGHT
//! frame into a written, calibrated FITS file.
//!
//! Two phases, deliberately separated so a batch can hold the catalog
//! connection for a moment and the pixels for minutes:
//!
//! 1. [`resolve_generation`] — catalog phase. Resolves the frame's master
//!    links, decides what actually applies, and builds the output header.
//!    Produces a [`GenerationSpec`], which is plain owned data: a batch can
//!    resolve every frame in one short connection borrow and then drop it.
//! 2. [`execute_generation`] — pixel phase, no database at all. Runs the
//!    calibration formula, the cosmetic hot-pixel pass, the optional OSC
//!    debayer, finalizes the header and writes the file.
//!
//! Nothing here records a tracking row or touches the catalog after phase 1:
//! a calibrated artifact produced for an export or a transfer is a product,
//! not a catalogued file.
