//! Shared `masters` command-layer handlers — single business-logic source
//! for the Tauri (`commands/masters.rs`) and web (`routes/masters.rs`)
//! wrappers. See `.superpowers/sdd/task-12-brief.md` and
//! `.superpowers/sdd/task-13-brief.md` for the design this module follows.
//!
//! Wires together Tasks 4-11 (compute queue, banded integration engine,
//! combiners, master naming/headers, registration) into the user-facing
//! "build a master from this calibration set" feature. `start_master_build`
//! is a plain sync fn that validates + registers a cancel handle on the
//! CALLING thread, then spawns a dedicated named `std::thread` that does the
//! actual queue-admission + integration + write + register. That
//! validate-inline-then-hand-off-to-a-worker shape follows
//! `commands/archive.rs`'s `start_archive_operation` (plan + commit
//! synchronously, register the handle in the active map, hand the real work
//! to a background worker that removes the handle and emits a finished
//! event) — NOT `api::analysis::analyze_frame_set`, which stays synchronous
//! end-to-end inside the caller's `spawn_blocking` and only returns when the
//! work is done. `preview_master_build` is pure DB work with no pixel I/O
//! (see the `select_flat_precal` / `load_precal_pixels` split below); both
//! transports' preview wrappers still call it inside
//! `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` (the `analyze_frame_set` wrapper
//! precedent) so even its DB queries stay off the async executor.
//!
//! Task 13 adds two more entry points on top of the same build-thread
//! machinery (see `BuildTarget` below for how `run_build`/
//! `run_master_build_thread` branch on New-vs-Rebuild without duplicating
//! the integrate -> write -> finalize pipeline):
//! - `start_master_builds_batch`: dependency-ordered fan-out of
//!   `start_master_build` over many sets (`plan_batch` is the pure/testable
//!   planning step — see its doc comment).
//! - `rebuild_master`: re-integrates an EXISTING master's source frames in
//!   place (same file, atomic replace) and refreshes provenance instead of
//!   registering a brand-new master set.

/// drop the master's own catalog rows, and remove its file from disk.

/// master keep the deleted master's uuid/path in their `ATH_C*` cards. Nothing
/// tracks them (calibrated-export v2 removed the tracking table), so they are
/// simply stale files on disk until the next export regenerates them.
