//! Preparation worker (transfer-prepare spec §3): stages a planned package into
//! `packages/<uuid>`, hashes it, writes the manifest, then hands the `queued`
//! row to the engine. One package at a time; cancellable; honest terminal on
//! failure; healed to `failed` after a restart.
//!
//! The split this module exists for: a `Send` used to copy and hash every
//! selected file *inside* the command, so the click did not become a row in the
//! Transfers list until the copy was over — minutes for a night of subs, with no
//! progress and nothing to cancel. Now
//! [`plan_selection_package`](crate::api::sync::plan_selection_package) only
//! reads the catalog and `stat`s the sources, the row is inserted `preparing`
//! with its full file manifest, and everything that touches bytes happens here.
