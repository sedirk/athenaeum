//! Resolving an object name against the bundled DSO catalog — the one place
//! both transports answer "does this name mean anything to the solver?".
//!
//! Why it exists: a frame with no RA/Dec in its header is solved blind, which
//! costs tens of seconds and often fails. If the frame says WHAT it points at,
//! `plate_solve::hints::apply_object_name_fallback` turns that name into a
//! position hint. So naming a target in the metadata editor is a real repair
//! for unsolvable frames — but only if the name is one the catalog carries.
//! This command lets the editor say so while the user types, instead of
//! letting them discover it after a failed solve.
