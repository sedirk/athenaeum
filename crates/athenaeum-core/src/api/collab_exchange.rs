//! Holder-side collaboration package exchange — request-to-serve (Stage II
//! collaboration, slice 4, task 6).
//!
//! When a project member asks us (a holder) to serve a package
//! ([`TransportEvent::ProjectRequestReceived`](crate::sharing::types::TransportEvent),
//! wired at the receiver in [`crate::api::sync`]), this module answers:
//!
//! 1. [`handle_project_request`] authorizes the requester
//!    ([`may_serve_package`](crate::collab::authz::may_serve_package) — a
//!    published package to any `send_receive` member or the coordinator, a still
//!    pending one only to the coordinator, Д1), reconstructs a servable directory,
//!    and enqueues an explicit-target send back to the requester through a
//!    DEDICATED collab sender map. Any authorization failure is a **silent**
//!    (warn-logged) drop — cross-account, no error is sent on the wire.
//! 2. [`reconstruct_serve_dir`] rebuilds a byte-identical package directory: a
//!    package I published (`origin='mine'`) returns its retained publication dir
//!    as-is; one I fully received (`origin='received'`) is materialized under
//!    `<sync_dir>/collab_serve/<package_id>/` from the retained manifest bytes +
//!    the landed contribution payloads (hard-linked, copy fallback), idempotently.
//! 3. [`CollabCleanupSink`] cleans a reconstructed `collab_serve` dir once the
//!    serve reaches a terminal state, while NEVER touching a retained
//!    `collab_pub` publication (Д4).
//! 4. [`ensure_collab_sender_engine`] mirrors [`crate::api::sync::ensure_sender_engine`]
//!    but binds a dedicated `<sync_dir>/blobs_collab` blob store (audit m7: a
//!    second `FsStore` over the personal-sync `blobs_out` risks the redb lock and
//!    the startup tag-sweep) and spawns each engine with the [`CollabCleanupSink`]
//!    + a host emitter so a project serve still surfaces `sync-progress` /
//!    `sync-finished`.
//!
//! Ungated (no render gate): depends only on `db`, `sync`, `sharing`, `collab`,
//! `package`, so it compiles in the headless (`--no-default-features`) build.
