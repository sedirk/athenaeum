//! Shared `lights` command-layer handlers: **export/send readiness** for a
//! frame set — the single business-logic source for the Tauri

//!
//! Calibrated-export v2 (spec `2026-08-31-calibrated-export-v2-design.md`)
//! retired the standalone Calibrate Lights flow: there is no dialog, no

//!
//! - [`ExportReadiness`] — the per-mode tally (in-scope lights, lights with no

//! - [`check_mode_ready`] — the ONE gate `export_to_wbpp` and
