//!   [`SyncReceiver`](crate::sync::SyncReceiver) and returns this device's
//!   pairing ticket for a peer (e.g. Perseus) to dial.
//! - [`get_status`] — a snapshot for the Transfers UI (dev flag, whether the
//!   transport is up, the ticket, and how many frames have been received).
//! - [`list_history`] — the received/sent transfer log.
//!
//! The transport lifecycle lives in a [`SyncRuntime`](crate::sync::SyncRuntime)

///   (dir-before-row: `write_package` populates `packages/<uuid>` incrementally,
///   and the `sync_outbound` row lands only once that build is done), so a fresh
///   DB read cannot see a row that does not exist yet. The payload-dir pass
///   additionally age-gates every row-less dir
///   ([`ORPHAN_SWEEP_MIN_AGE`]/[`dir_age`], see [`sweep_orphan_payload_dirs`])
