//! Per-frame master resolution for light calibration (moved out of the
//! `api` layer in Task 5 of the 2026-08-31 calibrated-export-v2 plan so the
//! export-side generator can reuse it without an export→api dependency).
//! Pure, connection-level, no pixel I/O — resolves ONE light frame's
//! calibration links (Dark/Flat/Bias) against the current catalog into
//! everything the light-calibration engine and the header builder need. There
//! is no tracking row: a calibrated artifact is a product of an export or a
//! transfer, never a catalogued file.
//!
//! Its consumer is `export::calibrated_generator::resolve_generation`. Errors
//! are `anyhow::Error` (never `api::ApiError` — this module must not depend on
//! `crate::api`, the whole point of the move), which is what the generator
//! propagates and what an export turns into one frame's skip reason.
