/// Per-endpoint fault injection knobs.
///
/// - `abort_after_bytes`: one-shot — the next `fetch` fails once it has copied
///   at least this many bytes, then disarms so a subsequent fetch succeeds.
/// - `duplicate_ack`: the next `ack` delivers its event twice.
/// - `delay_ack`: sleep this long before delivering an ack.
/// - `fetch_gate` / `ack_gate`: wait for the watch value to become `true` before
///   fetching (including serve-progress events) / delivering an ack. These
///   test-controlled gates let assertions observe a phase without racing a
///   short sleep. Dropping a closed gate's sender is an error, not a release.
/// - `delay_per_read`: sleep this long after every fetch read chunk, so a whole
///   `fetch` takes a controllable, non-trivial wall-clock duration. Test-only,
///   additive, off by default — the abort knob can only *fail* a fetch, so this
///   is what lets a test make two concurrent fetches genuinely overlap (the
///   bidirectional e2e's non-serialization proof).
/// - `fail_ack_once`: one-shot — the next `ack` returns `Err` once, then disarms
///   so a subsequent ack succeeds. Mirrors the real transport rejecting a re-ack
///   the sender already confirmed (the Transfers smoke №8 item-4 failure): lets a
///   test prove a failed replay ack never strands the inbound row non-terminal.
/// - `fetch_local_fault_once`: one-shot — the next `fetch` transfers everything
///   and THEN fails with a [`LocalFault`], mirroring the real transport's
///   materialize phase (D2 §3.2: the transfer succeeded, writing it to our own
///   disk did not). This is the knob that distinguishes "we cannot accept this"
///   from `abort_after_bytes`' "the peer went away" — the two land the inbound row
///   in different states.
