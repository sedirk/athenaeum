//! Plane geometry for image registration: linear transform models, the
//! two distortion layers (a SIP-style polynomial and, since M4c, a
//! thin-plate spline), a KD-tree for correspondences and a deterministic
//! RANSAC. Pure math, no I/O, ungated. Conventions: 0-based pixel
//! coordinates, integer = pixel centre; `forward` maps subject →
//! reference, `inverse` maps reference → subject.
