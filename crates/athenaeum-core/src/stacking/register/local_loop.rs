//! The local distortion correction loop (M4c, ruling R-M4c-7): a

//!
//! Per round: re-pair every subject star THROUGH the current map (linear
//! part and distortion together, not just the linear model) at a widening
//! tolerance; RANSAC a corrector homography on what the map still gets
//! wrong — predicted reference position → actual reference position; stop
//! once that corrector is the identity to within
//! [`LOCAL_DISTORTION_STOP`]; otherwise compose it into the linear part
//! and refit the distortion around the result.
//!
//! Extracted from `align.rs` in fix round 1 (minor 7): the loop is a

//! lines with it inline.
