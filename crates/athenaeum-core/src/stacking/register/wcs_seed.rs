//! A subject → reference alignment seed built from the two frames' stored
//! plate solves (M4b, ruling R-M4b-3), the way a coordinate-based aligner
//! works: sample a grid of subject pixels, project each one to the sky
//! through the subject's own WCS, project it back into the reference's
//! pixel grid through the reference's WCS, and least-squares an affine
//! through the resulting correspondences.
//!
//! Two frames at different pixel scales have no common quad geometry to
//! seed from cheaply, and the quad seed's tolerance is a ratio tolerance —
//! it degrades exactly where a 2x scale step puts it. When both frames are
//! solved this seed lands the subject on the reference to within a pixel
//! before a single star has been paired, and `align` then only has to
//! confirm it.
//!
//! Coordinates are 0-based pixel centres on both sides (`PlateSolveRecord`
//! and `WcsSolution` agree on this) — there is no ±1 anywhere in here.
