//! `.rej` per-frame rejection-bitmap format (spec §6.2, M3 ruling R-M3-8):
//! `RejBitmapSet` (writer, one file per frame in a run's group directory),
//! `RejBitmap` (reader), and `RejPlaneSink` — the
//! `integration::source::RejectionBitSink` implementation the engine's band
//! loop writes to when drizzle wants the survivor mask.
//!
//! These files are per-run TEMPORARIES, not `stacking_artifacts` rows: the
//! run removes `rej/run-<id>` at its single exit path (success, failure or
//! cancel) unless the user asked to keep everything, and `stacking::paths`'
//! `cleanup_work` sweeps any that survive a crash. There is no checksum
//! trailer (contrast `stacking::ln::grid`'s `.athln` sidecars, which persist
//! across runs and are read back into a later run's cache) — a truncated or
//! foreign `.rej` file is simply refused on read, never silently trusted.
//!
//! On-disk layout (little-endian):
//! ```text
//! offset 0   magic     [u8; 8]   b"ATHREJ01"
//! offset 8   width     u32
//! offset 12  height    u32
//! offset 16  channels  u32
//! offset 20  words     u32       ceil(width / 64)
//! offset 24  body      channels × height × words  u64 words, row-major
//!                      per channel (channel 0's rows, then channel 1's, …)
//! ```
//! Body word `(plane * height + y) * words + word_x` holds bits
//! `[word_x*64, word_x*64+64)` of row `y`'s rejection mask for that plane —
//! bit `b` set means the source pixel at column `word_x*64 + b` was
//! rejected (present but not a survivor) for that plane.
