//! The LN reference per group (spec §5.2, M2 Task 4): a low-noise,
//! resolution-shared integration of the group's best-weighted included
//! frames, built once and kept in RAM for the LN pass (M2 Task 5 measures
//! per-frame background/scale against it), and optionally written to
//! `ln/<group>/reference.fits` as an artifact ([`write_reference`] /
//! [`read_reference`]).
//!
//! [`build_reference`] shares [`crate::stacking::integrate::integrate_planes`]
//! — the ONE `RegisteredSource` per group (ruling R-T4-7: re-pointed at
//! each plane with `set_plane`) plus `integrate_stack` per plane that
//! `integrate_group` (Plan 4) also drives — rather than re-implementing it:
//! the only differences from a normal group integration are the frame
//! subset (the best `n` by weight, not every included frame), the weights
//! (all `1.0`, not the group's per-channel weights), the rejection recipe
//! (always linear-fit `5.0`/`3.5`, not the group's Auto-resolved choice) and
//! the normalization modes (always plain global `additiveWithScaling` /
//! `scaleZeroOffset`, never the group's own configured normalization or
//! `local`, which doesn't exist yet at reference-build time — the reference
//! is what later frames measure *against*).
