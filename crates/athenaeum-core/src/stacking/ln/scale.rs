//! Relative scale between one target frame and the LN reference (spec
//! §5.2, math §4.3): the RCR location of the matched stars' PSF-flux
//! ratios, `s = RCR_loc(flux_ref,k / flux_tgt,k)`. Task 5 subtracts this
//! into the additive term (`B = B_ref − s·B_tgt`) and later stamps it on
//! the grid as the multiplicative `A`.
//!
//! Detection and PSF fitting run the same detection + fit path on both
//! planes (`detect_seeds`, `DetectionConfig::default()`, `max_stars`,
//! `FitParams::default()`, native units) — except the model: the reference
//! fits with the caller's own `psf` choice, and the target always fits at
//! the reference's OWN resolved β via `psf_signal::fit_stars_with_beta`,
//! never its own independent `Auto` search — which is what makes the
//! ratios comparable (see `relative_scale`'s own doc for why). Both planes
//! are assumed already in the reference geometry (registered), so a
//! shared pixel position means the same sky position. Matching is a
//! nearest-neighbour pass: a [`crate::geometry::kdtree::KdTree2`] built
//! over the reference fits' centroids, queried once per target fit within
//! `match_radius_px`. The spec's "square half-side 4" window and this
//! nearest-within-a-circle query differ only at the corners of that box —
//! close enough that a second shape is not worth the code.
//!
//! **M4c (rulings R-M4c-8/9) added the two pieces M2 recorded as
//! deferred:** a BARYCENTRE second matching pass — when pass 1's pairing
//! covered fewer than [`LN_BARYCENTRE_PASS_THRESHOLD`] of the TARGET's own
//! accepted fits, the same nearest-within query runs again over the
//! DETECTION barycentres each fit came from and the larger of the two
//! pairings wins ([`choose_pairing`]) — and an optional LOCAL SCALE model:
//! with `normalization.local.localScale` on, the surviving ratios'
//! residuals `z_k − s` are fitted with an approximating thin-plate spline
//! ([`fit_local_scale`]) that `ln::normalize_frame` samples on the stride
//! grid as `A(x, y) = s + spline(x, y)`.
