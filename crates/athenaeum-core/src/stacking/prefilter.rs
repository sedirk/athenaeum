//! Pre-filters applied to the image the measurement's star DETECTION runs
//! on — never to the image the PSF fits, the aperture flux, the background
//! model or the noise estimate see (math reference §5.1: the reference
//! detector's structure map begins with an optional 3×3 median, "hot-pixel
//! filter radius 1", and everything downstream of detection still measures
//! the untouched pixels).
//!
//! Why this is a lever the detection threshold is not: a 3×3 median cuts a
//! star's peak by a factor that depends on how wide the star is. For a
//! Gaussian of σ px the four edge neighbours sit at `exp(−1/2σ²)` of the
//! peak and the four diagonals at `exp(−1/σ²)`, so the median of the nine
//! is the edge value — ≈ 0.31·peak at FWHM 1.55 px (σ 0.66) but ≈ 0.79·peak
//! at FWHM 3.4 px (σ 1.44). An undersampled frame's stars are therefore
//! suppressed ~2.5× more than a soft frame's, which is exactly the
//! sharpness-dependent factor a single `background + k·noise` threshold
//! cannot produce (M4a Task 2 fix round 1, ruling R-M4a-13).
