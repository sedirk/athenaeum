        // measured with the rank-budget seed population.
        //
        // And again in that task's fix round 1 (R-M4a-13): `seedPrefilter`
        // joins the same subtree. It ships `none`, i.e. today's behaviour,
        // so nothing about a run changes — but the stored JSON does, so the
        // fingerprint and the measure-stage hash move once more.
        //
        // Moved once more here (M4a Task 4, rulings R-M4a-5/R-M4a-9):
        // `reference.twoPass` joins `ReferenceConfig`. No STAGE hash folds
        // in `reference` (`registration_subtree` is `cfg.registration`
        // alone), so not one cached per-frame artifact goes stale over it —
        // only this whole-config fingerprint moves.
        //
        // And again here (M4c Task 0, ruling R-M4c-11): `seedDetector`
        // joins `MeasurementConfig`. It ships `peak`, i.e. today's
        // behaviour, so no run changes — but it DOES ride
        // `measurement_subtree`, so every set's cached measure artifact
        // goes stale once more, exactly as `seedPrefilter` did.
        //
        // And once more here (M4b Task 3, rulings R-M4b-4/R-M4b-5):
        // `registration.geometry` joins `RegistrationConfig`. It ships
        // `coRegistered`, i.e. today's behaviour, but it DOES ride
        // `registration_subtree`, so every set's cached registration rows
        // go stale once — deliberately: a row records which reference a
        // frame was warped onto, which is exactly what the mode decides.
        //
        // And here (M4c Task 3, ruling R-M4c-4): `integration.largeScale`
        // joins `IntegrationConfig`. It ships disabled, i.e. today's
        // behaviour, and NO stage subtree folds in `integration` at all
        // (`calibration`/`measurement`/`registration`/`normalization` are
        // the four), so not one cached per-frame artifact goes stale over
        // it — only this whole-config fingerprint moves.
        //
        // And once more here (M4c Task 4, rulings R-M4c-5/R-M4c-7):
        // `registration.tpsSmoothing` and `registration.localDistortion`
        // join `RegistrationConfig`. `distortion` still defaults to `off`,
        // so neither is read by a default run at all, but they DO ride
        // `registration_subtree`, so every set's cached registration rows
        // go stale once — deliberately, per the same reasoning as
        // `geometry` above: the fields decide what surface a stored
        // `transform_json` describes. The final fix wave then moved
        // `tpsSmoothing`'s own default from `0.0` to `0.5` (ruling
        // R-T7-1); that re-pins this literal but costs no SECOND
        // invalidation in practice — the field's arrival above already
        // spent the one re-registration, and a stored document that
        // spells `tpsSmoothing` out keeps its own value either way.
        //
        // And here (M4d Task 1, rulings R-M4d-1/R-M4d-2): `drizzle.bayer`
        // joins `DrizzleConfig`. It ships `false`, i.e. today's behaviour,
        // and no stage subtree folds in `drizzle` at all — deliberately,
        // since a debayered calibrated frame is byte-identical whether or
        // not the mosaic is kept beside it (see
        // `bayer_moves_the_run_fingerprint_but_no_stage_hash`) — so not one
        // cached per-frame artifact goes stale over it; only this
        // whole-config fingerprint moves.
