//! The structure-map seed detector (math reference §5.1, ruling R-M4c-11):
//! the second of the two detectors the quality measurement can seed its PSF
//! fits from (`measurement.seedDetector`).
//!
//! The peak detector [`super::measure`] has used since Plan 2 answers one
//! question per pixel — "does this pixel stand `k·σ` above the local sky?"
//! — and that is why its star population moves the wrong way with seeing:
//! a sharp night's star puts the same flux into fewer, taller pixels, so a
//! peak threshold *finds more* stars exactly where a structure-based
//! detector finds fewer (M4a Task 2, rulings R-M4a-1/R-M4a-13). This
//! module asks the other question — "which connected groups of pixels look
//! like a star?" — and reproduces that sharpness behaviour by
//! construction:
//!
//! 1. optional 3×3 median (the reference's radius-1 hot-pixel filter),
//!    which suppresses a narrow star's core far harder than a soft one's;
//! 2. high-pass: subtract a Gaussian of size `1 + 2^structureLayers`
//!    (5 → 33 px), truncate at 0 — this is what keeps galaxies, nebulae and
//!    sky gradients out of the map;
//! 3. 3×3 dilation, adaptive binarization at `median + 3·σ_noise` of the
//!    dilated map, 3×3 erosion (together a closing: it fills one-pixel gaps
//!    and holes, and leaves an isolated pixel isolated);
//! 4. connected components, then the per-candidate rules in the reference's
//!    own order (border, size, saturation, coverage, single maximum,
//!    detection SNR, kurtosis) and a barycentre for the position.
//!
//! Everything downstream of the seeds — the PSF fits, the aperture flux,
//! the background model, the noise estimate — always measures the UNTOUCHED
//! plane, exactly as with the peak detector's optional pre-filter. Inside
//! this module too: only step 1's copy is filtered, and every per-candidate
//! statistic (the ring background, the significant pixels, the barycentre,
//! the kurtosis) is read from the caller's plane.
//!
//! Units: the detector reads the plane in whatever units the caller hands
//! it and compares [`StructureParams::upper_limit`] against those units, so
//! the ADU-scaled copy `measure_plane` works on needs an ADU-scaled limit
//! (`measure::ADU_SCALE`), not the `[0, 1]` default. The noise estimator
//! carries an absolute floor tuned for 16-bit data, which is the other
//! reason the map is never rescaled into `[0, 1]` first.
//!
//! Where this implementation differs from §5.1's summary, all of it
//! deliberate and each measured where a number is claimed:
//!
//! * **Two rules §5.1 does not list**, both the reference's own: a
//!   structure whose bounding box is one pixel wide in either axis is
//!   rejected outright (it has no centre — a hot pixel, a read-out streak's
//!   tail, a noise residual), and after the size floor a candidate with
//!   another candidate within one pixel is dropped (two seeds on one star
//!   would count its signal twice).
//! * **Two different pixel counts.** The size floor
//!   ([`StructureParams::min_structure_size`]) counts the structure's OWN
//!   pixels; the coverage rule counts only the SIGNIFICANT ones (those above
//!   the local background). The reference makes the same distinction, and it
//!   matters: coverage asks how solidly a source fills its box, while the
//!   size floor asks how big the source is at all.
//! * **Local maxima are counted on the raw plane**, per significant pixel,
//!   instead of building a whole-plane maxima map first. Identical answer —
//!   a pixel is a maximum when it is strictly greater than all 24 of its
//!   neighbours and below `0.75·upper_limit` — for a few per mille of the
//!   work, since structures cover a tiny fraction of a frame.
//! * The noise estimator, the high-pass width and the missing rescale: see
//!   [`map_noise`], [`FILTER_EPSILON`] and [`structure_map`].
