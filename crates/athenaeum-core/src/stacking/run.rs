//! The stacking run thread (spec §8: "the permit is acquired first, so a
//! queued run waits behind an analysis or a master build"; ruling 2:
//! `start_stacking` returns `{ runId }` only). [`start_stacking`] validates
//! the plan, inserts the run + its group rows, registers a cancel handle on
//! [`crate::services::ServiceContext::active_stacks`] and spawns a dedicated
//! `stacking-run-<id>` thread; [`run_thread`] is that thread's single body —
//! catch-unwind around [`run_pipeline`], handle removal, `finish_run`,
//! writing `runs/run-<id>.json`, the terminal log lines, and exactly one
//! `stacking-complete` event, in that order, regardless of how the pipeline
//! ended. [`cancel_stacking`] just flips the registered cancel flag — the
//! thread notices it (inside the queue wait, or at [`RunContext::check_cancel`]
//! between frames/groups) and unwinds through [`RunError::Cancelled`].
//!
//! Plan 5a Task 6 lands the run thread itself, the progress/complete events,
//! and stage 1 (calibrate) — the calibrated-lights export's own generator
//! (`export::calibrated_generator`), reused verbatim, with per-frame
//! `stacking_artifacts` reuse keyed by [`crate::stacking::plan::calibration_hash_for`]'s
//! SAME hash the plan gate computes (ruling: a run and the plan that
//! preceded it must never disagree about what "fresh" means). Tasks 7-8 add
//! stages 3-9 to the SAME [`run_pipeline`]/[`RunContext`] this task defines —
//! see each item's doc comment for exactly what is provisioned now and
