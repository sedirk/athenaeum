//! Drizzle stage (M3, spec §7). `geom` is the pure geometry the stage
//! driver calls per source pixel: the reference ↔ output-grid coordinate
//! map, a source pixel's shrunk "drop" corners, forward-mapping those
//! corners subject → reference → output grid through a frame's `PixelMap`,
//! exact convex-quad ∩ unit-pixel clipping (rulings R-M3-1/R-M3-2), and the
//! 16×16 tabulated-kernel micro-drop table for the `circle`/`gaussian`
//! kernels (R-M3-3).
//!
//! [`drizzle_group`] (M3 Task 3) is the stage driver itself: per plane, per
//! included frame, it reads the whole calibrated plane once, and — for
//! every finite non-zero, non-rejected source sample — deposits its
//! (possibly locally-normalized) value onto the scaled output grid through
//! the configured kernel, banded over [`DRIZZLE_BAND_ROWS`] output rows in
//! parallel (ruling R-M3-6). `I / W` where `W > 0` is level-preserving
//! (ruling R-M3-2); `W / max(W)` is the weight map when
//! [`DrizzleInput::write_weight_map`] is on.
//!
//! M4d Task 1 (ruling R-M4d-2) adds Bayer drizzle: with a
//! [`DrizzleFrame::cfa`] source, every output plane is deposited from the
//! frame's ONE calibrated CFA mosaic and a source pixel only reaches the
//! plane of its own colour ([`geom::cfa_plane_of`]) — registration,
//! weights, rejection and LN are untouched, all still the debayered run's
//! in reference geometry.
