//! Monolithic XISF 1.0 writer (M4d Task 2, ruling R-M4d-3): the same
//! `(width, height, channels, &[f32], &[Card])` surface
//! [`super::writer::write_fits_f32`] takes, serialized as one XISF unit —
//! signature block, XML header, one uncompressed Float32 attachment. No
//! compression, no thumbnails, no properties beyond `XISF:CreationTime` and
//! `XISF:CreatorApplication`.
//!
//! File layout:
//!
//! ```text
//! 0        "XISF0100"                     8 bytes, the format signature
//! 8        header length, u32 little-end  4 bytes
//! 12       reserved, zero                 4 bytes
//! 16       the XML header                 header-length bytes, space-padded
//! 4096·k   the attachment                 width·height·channels·4 bytes
//! ```
//!
//! The declared header length INCLUDES the trailing space padding (trailing
//! whitespace after the root element is well-formed XML), so a reader that
//! computes the data position as `16 + headerLength` lands exactly on the
//! attachment instead of having to trust the `location` attribute alone.
//! The attachment itself starts on a 4096-byte boundary: nothing in the
//! format requires it and the reader this crate ships does not care, but a
//! block-aligned attachment is what other readers (and memory mapping) like,
//! so the header is padded up to the next multiple.
//!
//! The `<Image>` element carries `geometry="w:h:c"`, `sampleFormat="Float32"`,
//! `colorSpace="Gray"` (1 channel) or `"RGB"` (3), `pixelStorage="Planar"`,
//! `bounds="0:1"`, `location="attachment:<offset>:<size>"` and, when the
//! cards' `IMAGETYP` maps onto one of the format's own image-type literals
//! (`Master Light` → `MasterLight`, `Drizzle Weight` → `WeightMap`), an
//! `imageType`. `byteOrder` is left off: its default (little-endian) is what
//! this writer produces.
//!
//! `bounds` is NOT optional. XISF 1.0 §11.5.1: the attribute "shall be
//! specified for all Image elements serializing floating point real pixel
//! data" — there is no default representable range for a Float32 image,
//! and the external tool refuses the file outright without it ("Missing
//! bounds Image attribute, which is mandatory for a floating point real
//! image", the v0.6.2 masters). The v0.6.2 writer left it off on the belief
//! that `0:1` was the format's default; that was only OUR reader's
//! default. The declared range is the pipeline's own convention — every
//! master's samples are the u16 domain divided by 65535 (`ATH_CSCL`), so
//! `0:1` names the black and white points the array was built against, and
//! the reader this crate ships treats an explicit `0:1` as the identity
//! mapping it already applied. The range is a REPRESENTABLE range, not a
//! clip: a saturated star core above 1.0 is a sample beyond the white
//! point, which the format allows. Declaring the array's true min/max
//! instead would oblige every honouring reader to rescale the data, which
//! is worse.
//!
//! Samples are little-endian f32 in the SAME plane-major order the FITS
//! writer uses (all of channel 0, then 1, then 2), which is what
//! `pixelStorage="Planar"` declares — no reordering, no scaling.
//!
//! **Row order is a known limitation** (M4d Task 2 fix round 1, ruling
//! R-T2-1). XISF's convention is that row 0 IS the top row and no XISF
//! reader has a `ROWORDER` concept, but the array handed to this writer is
//! simply its source frames' order — no stage of the stacking pipeline
//! flips pixels, and a stacking master's `ROWORDER` is its source frames'
//! own, copied through calibration, registration and the master's card
//! build. So for a BOTTOM-UP set, or one whose cards carry no `ROWORDER`
//! at all (which the astronomical convention reads as bottom-up —
//! `crate::orientation`), an XISF viewer shows this file vertically
//! mirrored relative to the FITS file of
//! the same data. The pixels are deliberately NOT flipped here: a row flip
//! would have to transform the master's WCS too (`CRPIX2`, the CD matrix,
//! the odd-`v` SIP terms), which is a feature of its own and is recorded as
//! a follow-up. The WCS is untouched and stays correct for the array as
//! stored. What this writer does instead is state the effective order
//! EXPLICITLY in the keyword list — the copied value when the cards carry
//! one, `'BOTTOM-UP'` when they do not — so a reader is never left to
//! guess, and the stacking run warns once per bottom-up XISF master.
//!
//! **Reading one of these back is not symmetric.** rustafits' XISF reader
//! returns every float sample multiplied by 65535 (its ADU-domain
//! convention, ruling R-M4a-11) — a caller comparing pixels against what it
//! wrote must divide by 65535 first.
//!
//! Header cards are emitted as `<FITSKeyword name value comment>` children
//! of the `<Image>`, with values formatted by the same rules
//! [`super::card::format_card`] uses (so both containers of one master say
//! the same thing) minus the fixed-format column padding, which is a FITS
//! card-layout artifact with no meaning in XML — see [`xisf_keyword_value`].
//! Every card is run through `format_card` before anything is written, so
//! this writer accepts exactly the card set the FITS writer accepts and a
//! master can never carry a card in one container that the other refused.
//! The structural cards (`SIMPLE`/`BITPIX`/`NAXIS*`) are NOT emitted: the
//! `<Image>` attributes above carry that information, and the FITS writer
//! owns those cards itself rather than taking them from `cards`.
//!
//! **Not byte-reproducible.** `XISF:CreationTime` is the wall clock, so two
//! writes of the same image and cards differ in the header (the attachment
//! is identical). A FITS write of the same data IS byte-identical run to
//! run, so every byte-comparison pin and every acceptance-run byte
//! comparison stays on `output.format = fits`.
