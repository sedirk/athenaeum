//! The supervisor: a readiness-driven lifecycle around the capture [`Agent`].
//!
//! Perseus is an installable app. Its web status page stays up for the whole
//! process lifetime, but the sync **engine** should only run once the node is
//! actually ready to sync — signed in (a stored hub device token, or a dev
//! pairing ticket) AND at least one capture directory configured. The supervisor
//! owns that decision: it re-reads `perseus.toml`, computes the current
//! [`AgentState`], and launches or stops the agent as readiness comes and goes.
//!
//! The engine is created through a [`Launcher`] seam rather than by calling
//! [`Agent::start`] directly, so tests drive the exact same state machine over a
//! fake agent (no network, no filesystem watchers) while production wires
//! [`production_launcher`]. Task 4 uses the `on_agent` callback to attach and
//! detach the web server's [`WebState`](crate::web::WebState) as the engine
//! comes and goes.
