//! Perseus TOML configuration: parse + validate.
//!
//! The binding contract is the `perseus.toml` shape from the task brief. Perseus
//! is a **send-only** capability (Sync 2C): it signs into an account and sends
//! captures to explicit **targets**. There are two routes — an **account** (with
//! ≥1 target) or a **dev ticket** — and at least one must be present:
//!
//! ```toml
//! capture_dir = "/data/capture"
//! data_dir = "/var/lib/perseus"
//! # On Windows, quote paths with SINGLE quotes — in a double-quoted TOML
//! # string every backslash is an escape sequence and the file will not parse:
//! #   capture_dir = 'C:\Users\me\Astro'
//! #   data_dir    = 'C:\ProgramData\perseus'
//! mode = "auto"                             # "auto" | "manual" | "scheduled"
//! auto_quiet_secs = 60                       # auto: flush after N idle seconds
//! schedule_times = ["06:00", "14:30"]        # scheduled: local wall-clock send times
//! schedule_catchup = true                    # scheduled: catch up ONE missed point at startup
//! mirror_hierarchy = false                   # land sends in the receiver's stable capture mirror
//! device_name = "Observatory Pi"            # optional; defaults to the hostname
//! max_upload_mbps = 8                        # cap sync upload (MB/s); 0/absent = unlimited
//!
//! # Route A — account (recommended). Sign in with `perseus login`; the device
//! # token lands in a 0600 file in data_dir (NEVER in this TOML). `targets` names
//! # the account devices to send to (by device name or id).
//! targets = ["Studio Mac"]
//! [account]
//! hub_url = "https://projects.artfrom.space"
//! email = "me@example.com"                  # optional; prompted at login if absent
//! allow_default_relays = false              # dev only; see AccountConfig docs
//!
//! # Route B — dev ticket (offline dev / tests). Optional now that [account] exists.
//! pairing_ticket = "<paste from a receiver's Settings → Sync (dev)>"
//!
//! [retention]
//! policy = "keep_everything"                # keep_everything | on_confirm | keep_days | disk_pct

//! # i_have_verified_the_soak = true         # REQUIRED to allow dry_run = false (task M4)
//! ```
//!
//! # The soak opt-in (task M4)
//!
//! Live deletion (`dry_run = false`) is only accepted when the config ALSO sets
//! the explicit, greppable flag `i_have_verified_the_soak = true`. The two-key
//! handshake is deliberate: `dry_run = false` alone is treated as a
//! misconfiguration and rejected with an actionable error, so no operator can
//! enable irreversible source deletion without having consciously typed the soak
//! acknowledgement. Both default to the safe value (`dry_run = true`,
//! `i_have_verified_the_soak = false`), so a fresh config never deletes anything.
//!
//! Two optional tuning fields are additive (defaulted, absent from the contract
//! sample): `stability_secs` (write-stability quiet window, default 10) and
//! `poll_interval_secs` (re-stat cadence, default 2). Validation errors are
//! actionable — they name the offending field and the accepted values.
