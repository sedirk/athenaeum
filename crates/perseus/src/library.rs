//! The library path contract: how the web UI addresses files under a capture root.
//!
//! Every library route addresses a file as `(root_index, rel_path)`, where
//! `rel_path` is **always forward-slash separated** on the wire regardless of
//! host OS — the same convention the sync `rel_path` already uses. This module
//! is the single place that converts between that wire form and a real path on
//! disk, and it is the *only* containment guard: no route may join a
//! user-supplied string onto a capture root by hand.
//!
//! Two layers of defence, both required:
//!
//! 1. [`split_rel`] rejects hostile *syntax* up front — traversal (`..`), empty
//!    / relative-marker segments, native separators, drive-letter or
//!    alternate-data-stream colons, and NUL. A wire rel-path is a list of plain
//!    filename segments and nothing else.
//! 2. [`resolve_in_root`] canonicalizes **both** the root and the joined path and
//!    prefix-compares canonical against canonical. Syntax checks alone cannot see
//!    a symlink pointing out of the root; canonicalization resolves it, so the
//!    prefix check catches the escape. Comparing canonical-to-canonical also
//!    keeps Windows consistent (both sides carry the `\\?\C:\…` / `\\?\UNC\…`
//!    verbatim prefix) and absorbs macOS's `/var` → `/private/var` symlink.
//!
//! [`to_wire_rel`] is the inverse, for building listing and status payloads.
//!
//! Errors are [`anyhow`] with **stable message prefixes** that callers may match
//! on to pick an HTTP status: `"invalid path segment"`, `"path escapes root"`,
//! `"not found"`, `"canonicalize root"` (the configured root itself is offline —
//! a `502`, not a client error) and, from [`list_directory`], `"not a directory"`.
//!
//! [`list_directory`] builds on this contract: it turns one
//! `(root_index, rel_path)` into a single-directory [`LibraryListing`] whose
//! files carry the derived per-file [`FileStatus`].
