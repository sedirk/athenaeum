//! The running agent: durable sync store, ONE shared iroh node with a
//! `Role::Out` handle + sync engine **per configured send target**, and the
//! capture watcher wired together (Sync 2C multi-target send).
//!
//! [`Agent`] is transport-injectable. Production ([`Agent::start`]) resolves every
//! target ([`crate::account::resolve_targets`]) and binds ONE
//! [`SharedIrohNode`](athenaeum_core::sharing::iroh::node::SharedIrohNode) from
//! this install's device key — a single endpoint + blob store — then gives every
//! resolved target its own [`Role::Out`](athenaeum_core::sharing::iroh::node::Role)
//! handle onto that node + one [`SyncEngine`] per target, all sharing the one
//! durable store. Binding one endpoint *per target* (the previous shape)
//! self-collided on the relay: a relay keeps only one connection per node id, so
//! a multi-destination batch evicted its own peers (the same C1 field incident
//! the app hit). The Task 2 event demux disambiguates each target's acks by
//! `(peer, package)`, so the engines stay one-per-peer over the shared node. The
//! enqueue pipeline builds each package ONCE and fans it out to every engine — a
//! per-target failure is `warn!`-logged and never drops the others (spec §8).
//! Tests ([`Agent::start_with_transport`] for a single target,
//! [`Agent::start_with_transports`] for N) inject in-process loopback transports
//! and known peers, exercising the exact same enqueue/package/engine path without
//! a network (and without binding a node).
