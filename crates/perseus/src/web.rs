//! Perseus embedded web status page — router, auth, read + write endpoints.
//!
//! A tiny [`axum`] server, bound to [`Config::web_bind`](crate::config::Config)
//! (loopback by default), that lets an operator inspect and lightly manage a
//! headless capture node from a browser. The page is a slim two-tab shell
//! ([`index_html`]) whose Transfers + Settings sections are rendered client-side
//! by [`app_js`]/[`style_css`], over these endpoints:
//!
//! - `GET /` — the static, data-free HTML page shell. **Auth-exempt** (see
//!   below) so a browser can load it and then prompt for the token.
//! - `GET /app.js`, `GET /style.css` — the shell's static client script +
//!   stylesheet. **Auth-exempt** for the same reason as `GET /`.
//! - `GET /api/status` — capture dirs, live in-flight transfers, the current
//!   retention policy, and coarse package counts ([`StatusDto`]).
//! - `GET /api/transfers` — the grouped read model (one element per batch across
//!   every fan-out target) + `GET /api/transfers/events` for a batch's merged log.
//! - `POST /api/transfers/send-to` — send an already-recorded batch to another
//!   device as a brand-new transfer ([`SendToRequest`] → [`SendToReport`]), the
//!   source batch and its history untouched. Two steps on one route:
//!   `confirm: false` answers with "sends N of M" and builds nothing,
//!   `confirm: true` performs. Missing originals are dropped and counted; only
//!   an all-gone batch is refused (`409`).
//! - `GET`/`PUT /api/retention/policy` — read the live retention config +
//!   read-only soak gate ([`PolicyDto`]); a whitelisted [`RetentionEdit`] is
//!   applied to `perseus.toml` and adopted live. Live deletion can never be
//!   enabled here (the edit carries no soak field).
//! - `GET /api/retention/log` — the recent retention-pass ring buffer
//!   ([`RetentionRunRecord`], newest-first).
//! - `GET /api/library?root=<idx>&path=<rel>` — one directory of one capture
//!   root, each file joined to its derived send status
//!   ([`library::LibraryListing`](crate::library::LibraryListing)). Shallow (one
//!   `read_dir`, never a walk); an offline root is a `502`, not a `404`.
//! - `GET /api/library/preview?root=<idx>&path=<rel>&w=<px>` — one frame,
//!   auto-stretched to a JPEG ([`crate::preview`]). Serialized to one render at
//!   a time behind a small LRU, and ETag-conditional: a repeat look costs a
//!   `stat(2)` and a `304`. Inherits `/api/library`'s status contract, adding
//!   `415` (not a FITS/XISF frame) and `422` (a frame that will not decode).
//!   Without the `preview` feature the route answers `404 preview not built`.
//! - `POST /api/library/send` — send an arbitrary library selection now, as one
//!   explicit `browser` batch ([`LibrarySendRequest`] → [`LibrarySendReport`]).
//!   Selected files leave the batcher's pending set first, so the next
//!   auto/scheduled flush cannot send them a second time.
//! - `POST /api/library/delete` — delete a library selection
//!   ([`LibraryDeleteRequest`] → [`LibraryDeleteReport`]). Two steps on one
//!   route: `confirm: false` returns the per-file consequence preview and
//!   touches nothing, `confirm: true` performs and returns a per-path outcome.
//!   Nothing is ever forbidden except a Perseus-internal path (spec §2).
//! - `GET`/`PUT /api/capture-dirs` — the configured vs. running capture
//!   directories + a `restartPending` flag ([`CaptureDirsDto`]); a PUT rewrites
//!   `perseus.toml`'s capture selection, adopts it into the live config, and
//!   rings the supervisor so it applies the edit live (engine restart only, no
//!   process restart). The watchers keep their spawn-time dirs until that
//!   engine relaunch, which is the window `restartPending` reports.
//! - `POST /api/delete-files` — obligation-gated deletion of ONE batch's source
//!   capture files ([`DeleteFilesReport`]): the server re-runs the same
//!   [`obligation_verdict`] the UI showed and refuses (`409`) unless every
//!   participation delivered somewhere or the receiver closed it, then removes
//!   the sources through the shared safety contract and stamps the batch.
//! - `POST /api/delete` — history-delete whole batch groups ([`HistoryDeleteReport`]):
//!   drop the sender bookkeeping (outbound rows + per-file rows + journal + the
//!   `perseus_batch` row) of terminal batches. The `perseus_seen` linkage is kept
//!   so dedup identity + the retention audit trail survive.
//!
//! # Auth
//!
//! Bearer-token auth ([`auth_layer`]): when a token is configured, every
//! `/api/*` request must present `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. `GET /` is the
//! sole exemption — the static page shell must load without a token so the
//! browser's JS can then supply one on the `/api/*` calls. The `token` is
//! **snapshotted at spawn** — changing it needs an agent restart, which keeps
//! the middleware trivial (no shared mutable auth state).
