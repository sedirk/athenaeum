//! The send batcher: accumulate the watcher's stable capture files, flush them
//! as **one** package on the auto quiet-timer or an explicit manual signal, fan
//! that package out to every target, and record each file + the batch.
//!
//! This replaces the old per-file `spawn_enqueue_consumer`: instead of building
//! and sending a fresh package the instant each file stabilizes, the batcher
//! collects stabilized files in a [`BTreeSet`] and flushes the whole set at once.
//! Two things trigger a flush:
//!
//! - **Auto** ([`Mode::Auto`]): a quiet timer. Every newly stabilized file
//!   (re)arms a deadline `now + auto_quiet_secs`; when the deadline elapses with
//!   the pending set non-empty, the set is flushed as one `auto` batch. A steady
//!   drip of captures keeps resetting the timer, so a whole imaging run coalesces
//!   into a handful of packages rather than one per sub-exposure.
//! - **Manual** ([`Mode::Manual`]): no timer at all. Files accumulate until the
//!   operator hits "Send N pending" on the web page, which calls
//!   [`BatcherHandle::flush_now`] — the whole pending set goes out as one
//!   `manual` batch. A `flush_now` with nothing pending is a no-op.
//! - **Scheduled** ([`Mode::Scheduled`], 0.5.1 §3): a **wall-clock calendar**.
//!   Files accumulate all night and the whole set flushes at each configured
//!   local time (`06:00`, `14:30`, …) as one `scheduled` batch. Unlike the auto
//!   quiet timer, a newly stabilized file does **not** move the fire time: the
//!   schedule is a property of the clock, not of the capture activity. A point
//!   that elapses with nothing pending is a no-op flush that still counts as a
//!   fire (see [`fire_scheduled`]), and a point missed while the agent was down
//!   is caught up **once** shortly after startup (see [`startup_catch_up`] and
//!   [`catch_up_grace`] — the grace exists because a catch-up fired at the
//!   batcher's very first instant would always find an empty accumulator).
//!
//! The mode is read **live** from a [`watch`] channel, so a web-side edit takes
//! effect on the running batcher with no restart: switching to Manual disarms
//! both timers, switching to Auto re-arms the quiet timer if anything is already
//! pending, and switching to Scheduled (or editing its times) re-derives the next
//! fire from the wall clock.
//!
//! # Delivery + bookkeeping (the flush)
//!
//! One flush builds one package from the drained files
//! ([`build_batch_package`]), fans it to every target
//! ([`enqueue_package_to_all`]), and — only when at least one target accepted it
//! — marks the files it **actually packaged** [`record_seen`] and writes a
//! [`BatchStore`] row. A file that was present but unbuildable (won't parse /
//! stat / hash) is dropped from the package at build time and is deliberately
//! left unseen, so it is retried on the next detection / restart rather than
//! silently lost.
//!
//! A flush that ships nothing has exactly two fates, and they turn on whether
//! retrying could ever help. A **zero-target** delivery or a package that could
//! not be **written** (a file deleted mid-build, a full disk) re-queues its
//! drained files — they were never recorded seen, so the next flush retries them
//! and nothing is lost. A batch whose every file was individually unbuildable
//! ([`NoBuildableFiles`]) is dropped with a `warn!` instead: re-queuing frames
//! that cannot be parsed would spin the accumulator forever, and they stay unseen
//! either way. The batcher loop never fails on a bad batch — a single flush error
//! is logged and the loop continues.
//!
//! # The third sender: an explicit browser batch
//!
//! The library page can send an arbitrary selection *now*
//! ([`BatcherHandle::send_explicit`], batch mode `browser`, 0.5.1 §1a). That is
//! not a flush — the files are the operator's pick, not the accumulator — but it
//! must deliver and record identically, so both paths run the same
//! [`deliver_batch`] body with the same [`SendContext`] (engines, stores,
//! config, `origin_device`). The differences are exactly two, and both are in
//! the failure direction: a browser send takes its files OUT of the pending set
//! so the next auto/scheduled flush cannot send them twice, and it never
//! re-queues a batch that reached no target (it only undoes its own removal).
