//! Deleting capture files from the library browser — allowed always, honest
//! always (spec §2).
//!
//! The owner requirement this implements is blunt: the operator may delete
//! **anything at any moment**. So this module never refuses a deletion because
//! of what the file is *doing* — queued, mid-transfer, already delivered are all
//! deletable. Instead it makes the consequence explicit **before** the fact
//! ([`delete_preview`]) and reports exactly what happened **after** it
//! ([`delete_perform`]), file by file.
//!
//! # Two steps on one route
//!
//! `POST /api/library/delete { items, confirm: false }` plans and previews and
//! touches nothing; the same call with `confirm: true` performs. Both go through
//! [`plan_deletion`] over the same selection, so the dialog and the action can
//! only ever differ by what genuinely changed on disk between the two calls —
//! and that difference lands as a per-file outcome, never as a surprise.
//!
//! # The consequence matrix (spec §2), and where each row lives
//!
//! | case | behaviour | where |
//! | ---- | ---- | ---- |
//! | file is `queued` | taken out of the batcher pending set **first**, then unlinked — the next auto/scheduled flush never sees it; a delete that then fails puts it back | [`delete_perform`] step 1 |
//! | file is in an **in-flight** batch | deleted anyway; the transfer completes from the package's payload *copy*. The preview NAMES the batch so the operator knows | `in_flight_batches` |
//! | file was in a **confirmed** batch | deleted freely; that batch's re-send degrades to its eligible subset later | `confirmed_batches` |
//! | file **reappears** later | [`SeenStore::mark_deleted`] stamps the row, and [`SeenStore::should_enqueue`] treats anything found at a stamped path as new; the running watchers are told to un-emit the path, so the recreation is discovered in this run and not only after a restart | [`delete_perform`] step 4 + [`WatcherForget`](crate::watcher::WatcherForget) |
//! | delete races a flush | already safe — the batcher drops vanished files with a `warn!` | batcher |
//! | directory delete | recursive, files first by the rules above, then empty dirs deepest-first; one file's failure never strands its siblings | [`delete_perform`] |
//! | audit | one `sync_history` row per deleted file, written BEFORE the unlink | [`write_deletion_audit`] |
//!
//! # What is refused
//!
//! Exactly one thing: a path that resolves inside Perseus's own `data_dir` or
//! package staging area ([`DeleteOutcomeDto::Refused`], reason
//! [`INTERNAL_PATH_REASON`]). That is defence in depth on top of the containment
//! guard rather than a duplicate of it — the guard proves a path is inside a
//! *capture root*, which is not the same question as "is it ours", and an
//! operator who nests `data_dir` inside a capture root by misconfiguration must
//! not be able to delete the agent's own database from a file listing.
//!
//! # Symlinks: the link is the victim, never its target
//!
//! [`resolve_in_root`] canonicalizes, so it hands back a symlink's *target* —
//! perfect as a containment proof (a link out of the root is rejected there) and
//! wrong as a deletion target (unlinking the target would leave the operator's
//! selected entry behind as a dangling link and destroy a file they did not
//! pick). Every victim is therefore re-derived as *canonical parent + own name*
//! ([`victim_path`]): identical to the canonical path for an ordinary file, and
//! the link itself for a link. It is also the exact spelling the listing keys
//! on, so the pending / seen / batch joins line up.

///    `(size, mtime)` re-capture at that path is treated as new (spec §2's
///    reappear row). A failure here is logged, not fatal: the file is already
///    gone and audited.
///
/// Once every file has been through those four steps, the pass makes ONE batched
/// [`WatcherForget::forget`](crate::watcher::WatcherForget::forget) call carrying
/// every path it actually unlinked. That is the in-process second half of step 4:
/// the watcher skips paths it has already emitted *before* it consults the seen
/// store, so without it a re-capture at a deleted path is invisible — no error,
/// no log — until the agent restarts. Batched per pass rather than per file so a
/// 200-frame directory delete costs one message per watcher, not 200.
///
/// One file's failure never stops the pass — the operator asked for a set, and a
/// permission hole on one frame must not strand the other ninety-nine.
///
/// A file whose pair was taken out of the pending set by a pass that then does
/// NOT delete it gets that pair back ([`BatcherHandle::restore_pending`], which
/// also re-arms the auto quiet timer). The removal is a promise about a file
/// that is about to stop existing; when the delete fails, the file is still
/// there and still unsent, and nothing else would ever put it back — the
/// watcher's sweep skips paths it has already emitted, so a pending path it
/// still holds is never re-enqueued. Dropping it would silently cancel its send
/// for the life of the process while telling the operator only "delete failed".
