//! Operator resend surfaces for the web console (Transfers Batch Model v2.1):
//!
//! - [`resend_in_place`] — the sanctioned retry: reset the SAME outbound row
//!   (`generation`+1, fresh per-attempt wire id) and re-drive it on its own
//!   peer's engine. Works for `failed`, `cancelled` (sender-side), and —
//!   because [`rebuild_package_payloads`] can resurrect a cleaned package dir
//!   from the original capture files — `confirmed` rows ("Send again" after
//!   the receiver deleted its copies). Same `batch_uuid` ⇒ the receiver's
//!   existing inbound row resets in place; its dedup handshake re-ingests only
//!   what is actually missing on that side.
//! - [`send_batch_to_target`] — mint a NEW transfer from an already-recorded
//!   batch, to any peer with a running engine: fresh dir basename ⇒ fresh wire
//!   `batch_uuid` ⇒ a brand-new inbound row on that peer. Its payload comes
//!   from the package dir when it still holds one, else from the original
//!   capture files (eligible subset: what is gone is dropped and counted, only
//!   an all-gone batch is refused). [`SourceDisposition`] decides what happens
//!   to the source identity.
//! - [`resend_declined_as_new`] — the deliberate operator re-ask for a
//!   **receiver-declined** transfer, i.e. [`send_batch_to_target`] back at the
//!   row's own peer with the declined identity retired. A decline is final per
//!   `batch_uuid` (same-batch re-announces bounce all-cancelled, and Perseus's
//!   autonomous retries must never override a human decline), so the new
//!   `batch_uuid` is what gets the receiver a fresh inbound row, while the
//!   declined row stays as history.
//!
//! Mirrors the desktop's `api::sync::resend_transfer` /
//! `resend_declined_as_new_transfer` semantics, rebuilt on Perseus's own
//! bookkeeping (`perseus_seen` / `perseus_batch_files`; the desktop had its own
//! `sync_sources` linkage, welded to `ServiceContext` and not extractable — and
//! removed outright on 2026-08-29, since the app never deletes a sent source.
//! The shared core primitives ARE reused: `reset_outbound_for_resend`,
//! `CANCELLED_BY_RECEIVER_DETAIL`, `read_manifest` / `xxh3_full_file`).
