//! Comment-preserving write-back of the web-editable config fields.
//!
//! The web settings page (tasks 9/10) lets an operator tune retention, capture
//! dirs, targets, device name, and send mode live. Each `apply_*_edit` performs
//! the file edit: it rewrites **only** the handful of whitelisted keys via
//! [`toml_edit`], leaving every other key, comment, and layout byte untouched (a
//! trailing inline comment on a rewritten value line is the sole exception —
//! value replacement drops that key's own suffix decor), then re-parses +
//! re-validates the whole file and swaps it in atomically (`tmp` + rename).
//!
//! # Two-tier validation: field edits check syntax, not run-readiness
//!
//! Re-validation here runs at the **parse-valid** tier
//! ([`Config::from_toml_str_lenient`] → [`Config::validate_structure`]): syntax,
//! every field-level constraint, path shapes, and the internal consistency of
//! what IS present. It deliberately does NOT run the **run-ready** tier
//! ([`Config::validate`] → [`Config::validate_ready`], which additionally demands
//! at least one capture directory AND a send target). Run-readiness is a
//! run/start concern the supervisor surfaces as a [`crate::config::SetupNeed`];
//! it must never block editing an unrelated field. Before this split, editing any
//! field (e.g. the device name) on a fresh config that had no `targets` /
//! `pairing_ticket` yet was wrongly rejected with "no send target configured".
//!
//! The two live-deletion soak keys (`dry_run = false` requires
//! `i_have_verified_the_soak = true`) live in the parse-valid tier, so they are
//! still enforced here: the only deletion-bearing field a web edit can touch is
//! `dry_run`, and turning it off while the on-disk `i_have_verified_the_soak`
//! stays `false` is caught by [`Config::validate_structure`] and refused — the
//! file is left untouched (the edit happens on an in-memory copy, written only
//! after validation passes). Enabling live deletion therefore remains a
//! deliberate two-key edit an operator makes by hand, never something the web UI
//! can do.
